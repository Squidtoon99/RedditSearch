Every single person will have to face Jesus Christ, not just some of us.  If the Apostle Paul that wrote it wasn't special, neither are you and me. This should be as good of reason as any to make sure the discussion revolves around the good.  \n\nYou can start writing the good right now if you choose to, or this can be another conversation you have later about why now wasn't a good time to live for Jesus Christ, that reading about Him on Sundays and getting dunked in water was enough. Actions speak louder than words.  Will Christ say that people new you as a disciple, or a fake?\n\nI am giving you a new commandment, that you love one another; just as I have loved you, that you also love one another. By this all people will know that you are My disciples: if you have love for one another.\u201d\nJohn 13:34\u202d-\u202c35 \n\nI want that conversation with Jesus Christ to be a discussion about how I lived to Glorify the Father by pointing everyone I could to His Son, Jesus Christ, who offers Salvation to all.  What better way to Glorify Him than to add to the Kingdom through Christ Jesus?  The Father wants to adopt us all into the family.  The more that are adopted through the Son, the more He is Glorified.\n\nCount your blessings and remember what He pulled you out of when you were willing to admit, believe and confess.  You were saved by Grace, and He has enough Grace and Mercy for everyone that wants it.\n\nwho wants all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth. For there is one God, and one mediator also between God and mankind, the Man Christ Jesus, who gave Himself as a ransom for all, the testimony given at the proper time.\n1 Timothy 2:4\u202d-\u202c6",

Its taken the property down to a 4.67 stars. Its an entire apartment, one of 2, the bottom level and unfortunately these people must have thought it was the entire property as when they got here they asked 'how do I use the elevator to the top floor'. I responded quickly and politely - the listing is very clear and whilst the review only said \"It\u2019s alright. Need some maintenance. Host is a quick response and gentleman.\" I'm guessing this was the issue.\n\nThey've proceeded with 2 stars for the listing being inaccurate, also reported maintenance and 2 stars for value ect. the place is spotless and well priced. Is there any recourse for reviews that are complete lies? So frustrating!\n\nI've sent them a message in-app asking for more information but heard nothing.",

    "selftext": "Often, people with autism are seen as less \"socializable,\" but in my case, it was sometimes the opposite. Social norms, typically understood through subtle cues and contextual hints, became to me a set of strict rules that had to be followed, My worldview is often organized into rules and structured frameworks, and I treated gender roles in much the same way\u2014seeing them not as flexible social norms but as rigid directives dictating my behavior, interactions, and even thoughts. If a guideline wasn't explicitly stated, I struggled to understand it and I had strong opinions when I was younger. At some point I learned that there are rules I have to follow that I don't seem to understand. Wwhen norms were clearly articulated, I accepted them without question.\n\nFor instance, when someone said, \"Women should be nurturing,\" or \"Men are better at math,\" I took those statements literally. They weren't just societal viewpoints or stereotypes to me; they were factual imperatives that I felt obligated to follow. This wasn't just about conforming; I truly believed these roles were fixed and unalterable truths. My belief in these norms profoundly influenced my choices and actions, as I assumed these gender roles were immutable facts and rules one was obliged to follow, not open to interpretation or revision.\n\nThis has often put me at a crossroads: the dilemma of remaining true to myself or complying with what I considered to be non-negotiable societal expectations. While I've often failed to align with these expectations and complied relatively little compared to what I perceived was expected, I still find myself conforming more than I'd like to.\n\nMy partner often observes that my behavior is significantly influenced by what others explicitly tell me. This extends beyond social norms and gender roles. For example, I once received a 'B' on a physics test because the classroom setting overwhelmed me during an essay. When I sought advice and was told that this grade represented my intellectual limit, I took it to heart. I didn't question the claim, despite having an IQ of 140 and exhibiting strengths in visuospatial and logical domains. \n\nWhen I've expressed a need or requested an accommodation and was told \"no,\" I also took that response literally. In my mind, it meant that I was categorically not allowed to have that accommodation. This led me to push through situations that were uncomfortable or undesirable, simply because I believed I had no other option.\n\nSimilarly, when I expressed dislikes or personal preferences and others tried to broaden my perspective or encourage me, I often took their words at face value. I interpreted their attempts to enlighten or motivate me as an indication that my original feelings or thoughts were incorrect, rather than seeing their comments as just another viewpoint or a form of encouragement.\n\nMy difficulty in asserting myself likely adds another layer to this issue. I often find it challenging to counter what is being said to me, not just because I take things literally but also because I'm not always sure how to effectively articulate an alternative perspective. This combination of literal interpretation and difficulty in self-assertion has often led me to accept conditions or beliefs that don't align with my true self, needs, or capabilities.  \n\n\nIt seems like these aspects of autism (but this also applies to things like meltdowns, being naive and so on) are rarely talked about because the condition is often associated with men and stereotypes of hyperlogical thinking! Or other aspects that hurt mainly women. I have certainly not been perceived as gender non conforming. Some of my autistic traits read as very masculine, others as pretty feminine.   \n\n\nWhile it's true that the autistic mindset often follows \"if p, then q\" logic, this is only interpreted through \"men - logic - correct - no emotion\". Other implications that align more with feminine coded behaviors aren't talked about. Black and white emotional thinking, distress when things don't go as planned. I suspect that this gap in understanding is partly rooted in gender roles and societal perceptions. For example, people with Borderline Personality Disorder often exhibit similar \"system-oriented\" thinking styles and have high systemizing ability (meaning \"if p then q\") and have strong emotional reactions and black-and-white thinking. However, the narrative around BPD often emphasizes emotional intensity, while the narrative around AS tends to focus on logic and lack of social skills. This discrepancy in portrayal seems to be influenced by the different ways society views and describes individuals based on their gender and diagnosis. ",

Pat yourself on the back if you worked your way through all lessons!\n\nYou\u2019ve seen that a continual emphasis for a sysadmin is to automate as much as possible, and also how in Linux the system is very \u201ctransparent\u201d - once you know where to look!\n\nToday, on this final session for the course, we\u2019ll cover how to write small programs or \u201cshell scripts\u201d to help manage your system.\n\nWhen typing at the Linux command-line you're directly communicating with \"the command interpreter\", also known as \"the shell\". Normally this shell is _bash_, so when you string commands together to make a script the result can be called either a '\"shell script\", or a \"bash script\".\n\nWhy make a script rather than just typing commands in manually?\n\n* It saves typing. Remember when we searched through the logs with a long string of `grep`, `cut` and `sort` commands? If you need to do something like that more than a few times then turning it into a script saves typing - and typos!\n* Parameters. One script can be used to do several things depending on what parameters you provide\n* Automation. Pop your script in _/etc/cron.daily_ and it will run each day, or install a symlink to it in the appropriate _/etc/rc.d_ folder and you can have it run each time the system is shut down or booted up.\n\n## START WITH A SHEBANG!\n\nScripts are just simple text files, but if you set the \"execute\" permissions on them then the system will look for a special line starting with the two characters \u201c#\u201d and \u201c!\u201d - referred to as the \"shebang\" (or \"crunchbang\") at the top of the file.\n\nThis line typically looks like this:\n\n     #!/bin/bash\n\nNormally anything starting with a \"#\" character would be treated as a comment, but in the first line and followed by a \"!\", it's interpreted as: _\"please feed the rest of this to the /bin/bash program, which will interpret it as a script\"_. All of our scripts will be written in the _bash_ language - the same as you\u2019ve been typing at the command line throughout this course - but scripts can also be written in many other \"scripting languages\", so a script in the Perl language might start with `#!/usr/bin/perl` and one in Python `#!/usr/bin/env python3`\n\n## YOUR FIRST SCRIPT\n\nYou'll write a small script to list out who's been most recently unsuccessfully trying to login to your server, using the entries in _/var/log/auth.log_.\n\nUse `vim` to create a file, `attacker`, in your home directory with this content:\n\n     #!/bin/bash\n     #\n     #   attacker - prints out the last failed login attempt\n     #\n     echo \"The last failed login attempt came from IP address:\"\n     grep -i \"disconnected from\" /var/log/auth.log|tail -1| cut -d: -f4| cut -f7 -d\" \"\n\nPutting comments at the top of the script like this isn't strictly necessary (the computer ignores them), but it's a good professional habit to get into.\n\nTo make it executable type:\n\n`chmod +x attacker`\n\nNow to run this script, you just need to refer to it by name - but the current directory is (deliberately) not in your $PATH, so you need to do this either of two ways:\n\n     /home/support/attacker\n     ./attacker\n\nOnce you're happy with a script, and want to have it easily available, you'll probably want to move it somewhere on your $PATH - and _/usr/local/bin_ is a normally the appropriate place, so try this:\n\n`sudo mv attacker /usr/local/bin/attacker`\n\n...and now it will Just Work whenever you type `attacker`\n\n## EXTENDING THE SCRIPT\n\nYou can expand this script so that it requires a parameter and prints out some syntax help when you don't give one. There are a few new tricks in this, so it's worth studying:\n\n     #\n     ##   topattack - list the most persistent attackers\n     #\n     if [ -z \"$1\" ]; then\n     echo -e \"\\nUsage: `basename $0` <num> - Lists the top <num> attackers by IP\"\n     exit 0\n     fi\n     echo \" \"\n     echo \"Persistant recent attackers\"\n     echo \" \"\n     echo \"Attempts      IP \"\n     echo \"-----------------------\"\n     grep \"Disconnected from authenticating user root\" /var/log/auth.log|cut -d: -f 4 | cut -d\" \" -f7|sort |uniq -c |sort -nr |head -$1\n\nAgain, use vim to create `\"topattack\"`, `chmod` to make it executable and `mv` to move it into _/usr/local/bin_ once you have it working correctly.\n\n(BTW, you can use `whois` to find details on any of these IPs - just be aware that the system that is \"attacking\" you may be an innocent party that's been hacked into).\n\nA collection of simple scripts like this is something that you can easily create to make your sysadmin tasks simpler, quicker and less error prone.\n\nIf automating and scripting many of your daily tasks sounds like something you really like doing, you might also want to script the setup of your machines and services. Even though you can do this using bash scripting like shown in this lesson, there are some benefits in choosing an orchestration framework like ansible, cloudinit or terraform. Those frameworks are outside of the scope of this course, but might be worth reading about.\n\nAnd yes, this is the last lesson - so please, feel free to write a review on how the course went for you and what you plan to do with your new knowledge and skills!\n\n## RESOURCES\n\n* [Learn Bash Scripts - Tutorial (video)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGvvJO5UIs4)\n* [Bash scripting tutorial](http://linuxconfig.org/Bash_scripting_Tutorial)\n* [BASH Programming - Introduction HOW-TO](http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prog-Intro-HOWTO.html)\n* [How to be a good (and lazy) System Administrator](http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/how-be-good-and-lazy-system-administrator)\n\n*Copyright (c) 2012-2021 @snori74 (Steve Brorens) - Open Source since 2021 under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence (CC BY 4.0)*\n\n\n## PREVIOUS DAY'S LESSON\n * [Day 19 - Inodes, symlinks and other shortcuts](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxupskillchallenge/comments/165v1mz/day_19_inodes_symlinks_and_other_shortcuts/)\n\n*Copyright 2012-2021 @snori74",

He was not joking. I have been through natural child birth and kidney stones and the pain from this surgery has been worse than those two things combined. I woke up from anesthesia screaming in pain from the surgery. It was causing referred pain to my left arm. I thought they broke my arm. Referred pain is no joke. I didn't have much gas pain thankfully but the diaphragm pain and arm pain were 20/10 pain. I literally wanted to kill myself that night. Time was moving so slow and I couldn't rest or walk because of the pain. Thinking about that first 24 hours puts me in a trauma response. By hour 36 my pain was down to a 9/10 and I could finally sleep. Oh, and how can I forget to talk about the nausea... I'm still having trouble keeping stuff down. I even stayed another night at the hospital to control my pain and nausea. It's currently Aug 31 and my pain is now at a 6/10. I can still barely breathe without it hurting but I'm so grateful the arm pain is under control. I asked the nurses why I was in so much more pain than I'd imagined and all of them said it was because of the hernia. Did anyone else have double surgery as well? I'm not trying to scare anyone. I just wish I would've been prepared more for what happened.",

So what's up my name is Salvador I am posting this from the PNW. I just turned 22 and I have finally started living my life. I moved states to be with the love of my life( met online) and to branch out of a toxic home life. I have started doing all of the things I have always wanted to do from Hiking and camping, daily working out, getting my dream job as a mechanic( appreciate), etc. I am discovering who I am and what I want to be in this life when before I didn't really have a option. See with the huge move and time just moving on with people getting busy and starting their own lives I have found myself losing people from some dying, some ghosting, some being busy with jobs, school,even kids so only being able to chat once in a blue moon.  I went from having a whole group of people that I thought we were going to be friends forever to one person who is a brother to me, My girlfriend of 7 years and her family , and some of my family members back home. I am sure alot of you here have a similar story to mine. So here I am trying to make friends with strangers on the internet the one thing mom always yelled at me to never do after she saw a news article about internet creeps doing bad things. I won't bore you with a list of my favorite color or food or what band I like the most. If you want to get to know me or just have a polite chat shot me a text. I am a little bit of a gamer to mostly apex , R6 and some rpg/story games(Xbox one) so if you need a duo that you want to carry dm me.",

    "selftext": "My husband and I have 2 sons (10 and 23) and 2 daughters (16 and 19). This post concerns my daughters, Ella (16) and Olive (19). A few days ago Ella asked Olive to pick her up from school, take her to her friends house to pick up a couple things she left there, and take her home after class. Olive agreed. \n\nThe day Olive was supposed to pick Ella up, she called Ella and said she had to get gas, pick up some food for herself, go to the bank, do some shopping for MIL, then drop off whatever she was getting to MIL. She asked Ella to call their uncle (who doesn\u2019t like Ella) and ask him to take her. Then she called back and said my FIL got home early and can pick her up, all she had to do was call when she wanted to go. \n\nElla ended up never calling them and asked Olive to pick her up on the way back. Olive picked her up on her way to MIL\u2019s house and brought her to the house, 2 hours after she promised to pick Ella up. \n\nWhen they got inside, my MIL yelled at Ella for not calling my BIL or FIL to pick her up and for making Olive wait for her. Ella told my MIL that Olive agreed to do this, was 2 hours late, and didn\u2019t take her to her friends house but MIL yelled at her again because plans changed and Olive arranged for 2 other rides for her that wouldn\u2019t have been late and would\u2019ve taken her to her friends house. \n\nElla decided to wait in the car to avoid more verbal abuse and she assumed Olive would wrap it up but Olive left her in the car for another hour while she ate and talked to my MIL. \n\nElla told me what happened later that night. I called my MIL to tell her she had no right to speak to Ella the way she did. My MIL responded by telling me she wouldn\u2019t have to if I would and that somebody needs to punish Ella when she\u2019s being a brat. I told MIL that if she can\u2019t respect me and my kids I will no longer be running errands for her. \n\nMy MIL told my husband about this and they\u2019re all mad at me (they all favor Olive). AITA for refusing to run errands for her because of the way she speaks to Ella?",

    "selftext": "I think a good part of the fandom interprets le'garde's skin falling off when you use rot as d'arce's s ending being the canon one for her and i could not disagree more.\n\nFirst of all, d'arce's s ending states that when resurrected, le'garde was left with almost none of his former self. He went from a humble and ambitious captain to a monster who desired the suffering of all mankind. On the other hand, nas'hrah's dialogue with kaiser imply that le'garde in fact did ascend throught the throne in ma'havre and that they had their conversation about chaos and the nature of humanity prior to that. This couldn't have happened if le'garde was the merciless beast he becomes in d'arce's s ending. You can try to piece together how did he ended up that way (ascended as a new god) and try to associate it to d'arce's participation in the dungeons of f&h, but you'll end up coming across with contradictions one way or the other. \n\nMy personal guess abt le'garde's rot effect on his skin is that it will be his design for f&h3. Le'garde's design as the yellow king changes from f&h1 to termina, and it's easy to see why. In the 17th century, his delusions as a god were to be everyone's savior, and his design depict's him as a noble god of sorts with a gentle smile and most of his body naked, for he has nothing to hide since his motives are genuine and kind. In termina, he's almost entirely covered with his yellow coat and equipped with a sword. This shows that he's no longer the goodwilling humble captain he was in the first game, but a more somber, violent warlord.\n\nMy guess is that in f&h3 we'll see le'garde completely broken after his attemps to save humanity. After all, the existance of a third game would imply conflict on the part of humanity, and i could see le'garde growing resentful towards humans after trying to save them for more than 400 years and still failing despite all. The fact that rot is the skill that makes le'garde's skin to fall off also has symbolic significance. Rot is a skill learned by having max affinity with the gof&h, which was his daugther. My final guess would be that le'garde's design for f&h3 would be that of a skinned man on yellow tatters, completely mad and desiring destruction to all humans. I think he would adopt this personality since even when he accomplished his part in the greater scheme of things on f&h1 by conceving the gof&h and making humanity progress forward, he's still unsatisfied and tries to get logic working, so it would make sense that he still tries to do something else.\n\nUnrelated but i wanted to make this post and i was thinking abt possible settings of f&h3 and i hyped up to the possibilites. More bc i want to see enki coming back le'garde's character arc coming to an end.",

I ask family and friends to show me there top 10 pieces and it all sound like artificial shit made just for money.

I\u2019ve also slipped up and accidentally unplugged it over time by getting up or playing with my pets, etc. never had any problems \n\nBUT the other day, I was wfh, and decided to do a backup - my last backup was about 30 days prior in July and I\u2019m now working on a short film, so I was like cool let\u2019s do a backup today. \n\nLong story short, it said backup was going to take 7 hours, which is odd cause I\u2019ve barely touched the laptop within the last month. So I stupidly, impatiently hit stop backing up on Time Machine; and now I get a message saying \u201cthe disk you attached was not readable\u201d eject, ignore, initialize\u201d\n\nThis is hurting my heart cause I strongly feel I caused this by just not being patient and now I feel like all my files are gone. \n\nBefore you all say anything, I know now to have a backup of the \u201cbackup\u201d.

Maybe uninstall Apache2 and install NGINX, a competing webserver. Keep a running stat on ssh \u201cattackers\u201d. Whatever. A free AWS will last a year, and a $5/mo server should be something you can easily justify.\n\n## Add services that you\u2019ll use\n\nYou should now be capable of following tutorials on installing and running your own instance of Minecraft, Wordpress, WireGuard VPN, or Mediawiki. Expect to have some problems \u2013 it's all good experience!\n\n## Extend your learning\n\nStop browsing articles on Gnome, KDE or i3 \u2013 and start checking out any articles like \u201c*20 Linux commands every sysadmin should know*\u201d. Try these out, delve into the options. Like learning a foreign vocabulary, you will only be able to use these \u201cwords\u201d if you know them!\n\n## Certs\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to do Linux professionally, and you don\u2019t have an impressive CV or resume already, then you should be aiming at getting a cert. There are really just three certs/tracks that count:\n\n* [CompTIA Linux+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/linux)\n\n* [LPI LPIC-1: Linux Administrator](https://wiki.lpi.org/wiki/Main_Page) \u2013 Very extensive description of the coverage of their various certs/courses.\n\n* [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/all-certifications-exams) \u2013 You could spend a lot of time and money here! (but it might well pay off)\n\nEven if you don\u2019t want/need certs, the outline of the topics in these references can give you a good idea of areas to focus on in your self-learning.\n\n## Affordable professional training\n\n* [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/search?keywords=linux)\n* [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/topic/linux/)\n\n* [CBT Nuggets](https://www.cbtnuggets.com/it-training/linux-found-cert-sys-admin)\n\n\n## Show your appreciation!\n\nSteve (@snori74) was a collector of postcards and enjoyed greatly all the \"Snail Mail\" he received from the students.\n\nBut since [his passing](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxupskillchallenge/comments/mki3uw/rest_in_peace_snori74/) there's nowhere to send postcards anymore. You can show your appeciation for the course by letting everyone else know how awesome it was! Show the world you finished the challenge by posting on [twitter](https://twitter.com/compose/tweet/?text=Hey%21%20I%20just%20finished%20the%20%23LinuxUpskillChallenge at https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Flinuxupskillchallenge%2F) and on other social media.\n\n**Thanks for all and happy linuxing!**\n\n\n*Copyright (c) 2012-2021 @snori74 (Steve Brorens) - Open Source since 2021 under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence (CC BY 4.0)*",

    "selftext": "So I\u2019m semi-panicking about student loans coming back to repayment. I don\u2019t mind the fact that I have to repay them (although forgiveness would be pretty sweet\u2026 it\u2019s not something I\u2019m expecting) and with repayment many of the plans, i.e., old REPAYE, want me to pay astronomically high amounts that simply don\u2019t fit into my budget after my car and rent. \n\nI ran the loan simulator on the .gov site and now I\u2019m stuck\u2026:\n\nOption 1 - SAVE\nBased on my income, my payments come out to $336/mo. then, of course, they adjust as my income does. Giving me protection to the downside, but forces me to make larger and larger payments to the upside. \n\nOption 2 - Extended Fixed\nPayments come out to $335/mo. and are fixed for the life of the loan. Meaning I\u2019m \u201cprotected\u201d should my income increase, but hosed if my income falls. \n\nI plan on paying ~$500/mo. so long as I don\u2019t ever need to tap into my emergency savings (~7k), in that event I\u2019ll replenish my savings then resume the elevated payments. In either case the loans will be paid off in approx. 9 years. I\u2019m just torn between which option is better. Based on my job, my income *should* rise pretty well over the next few years. \n\nI don\u2019t like the idea of being forced to pay more than I want to (SAVE) but I don\u2019t like the idea of getting stuck making payments that are higher than I can afford should something bad happen (EF). \n\nThoughts?",

To do this the user is to post something along these lines:a. Purchased Corsair K95 RGB Keyboard from [/u/username](https://www.reddit.com/u/username/)b. Sold Asus DirectCUII GTX 780ti to [/u/username](https://www.reddit.com/u/username/)After this post has been made, the other party is to reply with the simple response of **\"Confirmed\", and nothing else what so ever.**\n\nAlso, to make life easy on everyone and minimize missed verifications, **please only post one verification per comment**.\n\nLastly, this is **not** a place to review a buyer/seller, we are only confirming that a successful trade took place. This also means if an item is still in transit, the trade is not done! Come back when both sides can represent that the trade is fully complete including shipping and receiving.\n\nPlease do not clutter up this confirmation thread with anything that does not follow the format listed above.\n\n# PS.

    "selftext": "Should I pursue a higher education despite my families opinion?\n\nThis isn\u2019t a \u201chow to break into tech\u201d question as more as it is a comparative question. Recently, I\u2019ve decided to pursue a career is Data Science, with the hopes of eventually working in Engineering and eventually machine learning. I have a non relevant degree (chemistry), so I\u2019ve looked into getting my masters. I\u2019ve researched and found programs and am now working on getting some foundational learning and pre-reqs. I tell my family this plan and they are all extremely against it. My dad recently became a cloud engineer through doing a boot camp, and subsequently got my brother into it. He got him an internship with his company, and the company is now offering my brother a full time offer in a couple months. My brother especially won\u2019t stop lecturing me on how I\u2019m making a mistake. I know he means well, but from his not even a year of being in the field he likes to think he\u2019s an expert, and keeps badgering me on how I\u2019m just getting into this because I don\u2019t have other plans. \u201cI just don\u2019t want you to make a mistake because you don\u2019t even know if this is what you like\u201d. That I understand, I could do without the condescending tone but I get it. The problem is that he swears with certainty that I don\u2019t need a masters. He keeps bringing up anecdotal stories of people who went through the boot camp with him and now make 6 figure salaries. He\u2019s set on the idea that you don\u2019t need a higher degree to get into Machine Learning or working with AI and that you can competitive with experience. I agree on the experience part, I just feel like it would be hard to get my foot in the door without something like a masters in my toolcase, especially in this market. He swears up and down that it\u2019s useless, and that if he wanted to he could go apply and get high paying jobs right now if he wanted to with his internship experience. He\u2019s certain he\u2019s gonna make 6 figures in 2 years. I love him, but I think he\u2019s a little delusional. He has maybe 8 months of interning experience, no degree (he\u2019s starting his AS soon) and has 4 cloud certs. Now, I get it\u2019s possible but I truly don\u2019t think it\u2019s as easy as he makes it to be. I feel like his judgements been clouded by how easy it was getting his internship (which he only got through my dad). Am I wrong? Should I still pursue my masters and tell him to fuck off? Or is he right and i\u2019m the more delusional one",

I've been playing for a few years now and am becoming frustrated at some of the bugs: Slow PC moves (firing every battery 10 x per turn), the AI, power of SSM to schwack airfields until Iran has air superiority over the USA, and the poorly-designed scenarios.\n\nWhat annoys me most, though, is the fact that almost none of the scenarios are 'winnable'. You might get a tactical victory or a draw, but actual victories are hard to win and its frustrating to spend 30-40 hours on a game and have the end result be a screen that says 'DRAW\".\n\nAre there any interesting 1P scenarios in TOAW IV/ Is it hard to find opponents online?",

    "selftext": "I recently, after over a decade of stubborn refusal, finally made the switch from vanilla to Skyrim Anniversary Edition. Everything runs great, but I have one issue: the colours and the contrast.\n\nMy biggest issue is that my nights are too light, and when I darken them, the contrast is woefully low despite my in-game brightness settings being the same as in vanilla. I have used [Immersive Saturation Boost](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/32064) across both games, but it doesn't seem to quite like the AE's contrast as it drags it down. On AE, I have installed [Darker Nights](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/694?tab=description) and went for level 3, medium dark. The darkness is great, but once again, the contrast is washed out. [This](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F45bCtfWsAAkRCQ?format=jpg&name=medium) is how my game looks in vanilla, and [this](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F45bCuCWQAE2859?format=jpg&name=large) is how it looks in the Anniversary Edition. AE also has bluer colours that I love during the day but that are more exaggerated at night. For reference, here's [with](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F45QdXJXMAAS5PB?format=jpg&name=large) and [without](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F45QdXJWsAA_x0J?format=jpg&name=large) during the day. The loss of contrast is very visible here.\n\nAny idea for which mod(s) I could use to fix this contrast issue without pushing the saturation into neons? I have looked around but it seems the neons may be my largest issue in finding a match that doesn't require me to lose Immersive Saturation Boost's effects. ",

    "selftext": " \n\nDear Toilet,\n\nOh, how you've been my savior tonight, my faithful companion through the chaos that ensued after indulging in the wonders of a bottle of Malort. As I hunched over you, releasing the contents of my stomach and bowels repeatedly, I couldn't help but reflect on the strange, bittersweet affair I have with this perplexing liquor.\n\nMalort, oh Malort, you are a peculiar creature. Your taste, so uniquely bitter, hits the palate like a wave of unsuspected torment. But, somehow, amidst the initial shock, there lies a strange allure, a captivating charm that keeps drawing me back for more.\n\nThe first sip, it's like plunging into the depths of a murky pool, a plunge that leaves me gasping for air. The bitterness coats my tongue, seeps into every corner of my mouth, and yet, there's an odd satisfaction in the way it lingers. It's a challenge, a contest between myself and the drink, to see who will break first.\n\nAs I savored each gulp, the flavors unfolded like a complex symphony, each note revealing a new layer of intensity. Herbal and earthy, with hints of citrus and an eternal bitterness that cannot be tamed. It's like a dance between pleasure and pain, where the line blurs, and I find myself surrendering to your unique embrace.\n\nBut alas, dear Toilet, tonight was not one of those graceful evenings. Instead, it turned into a night of overindulgence, a battle of wills that I ultimately lost. My body rebelled against the sheer audacity of consuming such potent elixir, unleashing the chaos that now fills your porcelain bowl. And yet, even in this moment of discomfort, I can't help but feel a strange fondness for you, dear Toilet, for being there to catch me when I fall.\n\nSo here I stand, or rather, hunch, as I recount my intoxicated misadventures to you. You're my confidant, my silent listener, absorbing all my drunken ramblings and bodily fluids without judgment. You've witnessed the unglamorous side of my love affair with Malort, and though it may not always be pretty, it is undeniably real.\n\nThank you, dear Toilet, for your unwavering support and unconditional acceptance. I promise to take better care of myself next time, to approach Malort with a touch more moderation. But until then, I'll treasure our bond, our late-night conversations, and the solace you provide in moments of bodily distress.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nA Malort enthusiast in need",

Unfortunately, a schematic and board view are not available for this machine to see directly, otherwise I would go from there. It still thinks it has 8GB ram, when it really has 16GB on the PCB. (The banks are the same size, there are just double, so it still boots fine, meaning my soldering was successful) The UX3402 is the same laptop sold internationally with 16GB ram, so if anyone has one that they wouldn't mind popping apart to get a picture for me I would be very appreciative!\n\nI deduced these are the option resistors from a different laptop schematic with the same CPU (Acer, and the fact there are positions for each line to pull up to +1.8V or down to GND) but I need to know what actual pull ups/downs they should be for this new ram config!\n\nThe location is marked in the red circle on the one photo with a detail shot of what mine looks like, and what I'm kind of looking to see.  It is under the CPU cooler heatpipe heading towards the fan, adjacent to that side of the CPU. I will put out instructions for those looking to do this upgrade (that are experienced, soldering 4 317 ball BGA ics with no shorts/opens is no trivial task) once I know what to indicate to change.\n\nIf not, I will try to dump the BIOS and see what the laptop is expecting for them, but that will be monumental to do on its own, as the BIOS is 64MB on there.\n\nI still do not know why Asus only offered the 8GB ram version in the states with a 12 core CPU... I would've happily paid a bit more for 16 or 32GB from the factory, and otherwise the laptop is perfect for my needs!\n\nThanks to anyone who can help!\n\n\\-Andrew",

I just think life is sadistic so we gotta stay alert.\n\nAnyways, for my therapist my recent diagnosis (after 9 long years of searching for what was wrong with me) of ME/CFS is almost like natural development.\nBecause what other illnessess punish you for being happy and having a good time?\n\nBut even though I 100% see and appreciate the irony of this, and can see the parallels, I do not think in any way my illness is due to trauma.\n\nAfter being sick for 9 years and getting progressively worse, it kind of enrages me to feel like my very real physical illness is reduced to psychologial or somatic.\n\nI lived a fulfilling and happy and active life before getting sick, I\u2019ve worked a lot on myself all my life, to feel whole and at peace, and I had a wonderful life before, and I still do now, even if it\u2019s gotten very limited. My husband is amazing, my two cats are my loyal companions, my house is cozy, my bed is comfortable, I have a nice chair with bak support for showering, I can walk and groom myself, I can watch light hearted tv, I can listen to smooth music.\nI mean I truly am grateful.\n\nHave not needed psych meds in years, almost a decade even going through my diagnosis process. I try to create little spaces of softness for myself.\n\nSo I kinda recent that my therapist ist convinced it\u2019s intertwined with trauma.\n\nAm I wrong? I there a way for it to be all in my head?\n(Not at all my therapists words. She\u2019s a somatic therapist though so strong body mind connection for her but that\u2019s how it feels when I hear her connecting the illness to trauma, like it\u2019s all in my head.)\n\nSorry for the long post. Thank you if you made it this far.",

Her long hair falls loosely far down her back and, as an ode to her nickname, scarcely wears anything other than red. \\*Ice\\* never leaves her side, almost becoming a part of her and the fashion she wears to court.\n\n**Trait:** Hale\n\n**Skill(s):** Magic (Sight), Architect, Two-Handed Weapons (e), Footwork\n\n**Talent(s):** Whittling, Sewing, Taking long walks on the beach\n\n**Negative Trait(s):** N/A\n\n**Starting Title(s):** Queen of Winter, Queen of the First Men, Lady of Winterfell and Warden of the North, Lord-Elector\n\n**Family Tree:** [*Winter is Coming.*](https://www.familyecho.com/?p=A86Z4&c=c6j5gs971e&f=413594367731356982)\n\n**Starting Location:** Riverrun\n\n**Alternate Characters:** N/A\n\n**NPCs**\n\n**Princess Lyarra Stark, 18 -** ***Medic*** **-** Without any Stark siblings through which to inherit, the eldest of the Queen\u2019s Litter has been groomed as Heir Presumptive to the Kingdom of Winter since the day of her birth while Roslin was still the Crown Princess. Now the Crown Princess herself, Lyarra Stark tends to read and write more than her mother would like. Unlike her mother, she doesn\u2019t like long walks on the beach because she\u2019s never seen one, however she does have a penchant for Dornish blood oranges.\n\n**Princess Barbrey Stark, 18 -** ***Marksman*** **-** *The Princess of the Wolfswood* is a name that gets thrown around a lot in Winterfell, sometimes as a term of endearment though often out of frustration for Princess Barbrey\u2019s wild ways. Through her, the Stark line will continue after Lyarra takes the throne, though Barbrey is a middle child through and through. She much prefers the wilds and wilderness outside of Winterfell as opposed to the warmth and safety of its interior, and has become a crack-shot as a result.\n\n**Prince Artos Stark, 18 -** ***Questioner*** **-** The runt of the Queen\u2019s Litter, Prince Artos is a mothers-boy through and through. A quiet boy with angry eyes, Artos has a darkness to him not unlike Queen Roslin, however he\u2019s grown to be very skilled at curbing it in the public eye. He has a dog, *Pepper*, a greying and slightly goofy-looking mutt he took from the kennels as a child, that follows him everywhere.\n\n**Prince Alaric the Younger, 24 -** ***Warrior*** **-** Prince Artos the Younger, the eldest child of the Former Queen, was himself named after a Former King. He has a gloomy complexion, though it often goes unseen as he trains at arms in the yard. Much like Artos, Alaric also has a pet of his own - a cat he bought from a man in White Harbor a few years before his mother\u2019s death, called *Ser Knight*.\n\n**Prince Theodan Stark, 22 -** ***Tourney Knight*** **-** Prince Theodan was born and raised in a land recovering only by the grace of the Lords below the Neck. As a result, he\u2019s incorporated much of the Andal culture into his own life. He was knighted aged seventeen, and visits the Sept of Winterfell every night before bed.\n\n**Prince Benjen Stark, 19 -** ***Master-at-arms*** **-** Considering his eyes are blue, the youngest son of Queen Sansa II has an incredibly warm gaze. Prince Benjen is a rebellious sort, though not quite in the same manner as Princess Barbrey. He had a friend once, who he liked to go out and cause trouble with. After the friend was killed in a bar fight, Benjen Stark hasn\u2019t quite been the same.\n\n**Princess Bethany Stark, 18 -** ***Castellan*** **-** As Princess Roslin had been the strong right hand to Queen Sansa, Princess Bethany is the strong right hand of Queen Roslin. The only daughter of the Queen Who Bent The Knee has fallen into the family of Her Grace\u2019s as the fourth component of the Queen\u2019s litter, though of the four of them Bethany Stark holds the most power. She had always been a smart girl, and as such manages the day-to-day affairs of Winterfell and the lands around it as Roslin had done for Queen Sansa.\n\n**Biography**\n\nRoslin Stark was born during the final year of Queen Leona I\u2019s reign. She had never known her father, as Prince Karlon\u2019s life had been taken from him during the war against the new King Beyond the Wall. Her mother, Maeve Thenn, later remarried to Karlon\u2019s rival for her affection.\n\nWith the North being ruled by a Manderly in lieu of any Stark Heir, a year after her birth a candidate stepped forward to rule the North until a woman of House Stark came of age. Alaric Stark, a granddaughter of Queen Sansa I, promised to take control of the North until his daughter (also named Sansa) came of age, and as such was crowned as King until his eldest daughter reached the age of maturity.\n\nWith her mother remarried and her father dead, Roslin ended up incorporating herself into the household of King Alaric proper. She had begun to see him as a father and her grandmother, Lyanna Norrey, as a mother in place of the living one. As such, the King\u2019s living children had become sibling figures for Princess Roslin, though as the years went on King Alaric would outlive all of his children.\n\nIn 375 AC, only five years after he took the throne, King Alaric I abdicated in favour of his daughter Sansa on her sixteenth nameday. As such, Roslin was named Crown Princess and Heir to the Throne of Winter.\n\nIn what could be considered an odd display, Queen Sansa II would arrange for Roslin to be sent to ward at Oldtown when Roslin was eleven. The North would not reincorporate itself into the Kingdom of Westeros until many years later, and Roslin would not enjoy her time at Oldtown as Lord Malladore was a cold, almost cruel sort. Despite that, she would become good friends with his son and Heir Gerold, and would come to see him as a brother. Along side him came the future Lady Meredyth Caswell, who Roslin would occasionally write to after her return to Winterfell.\n\nWhile she had been intended to return earlier, the outbreak of the Winter Blight would force Queen Sansa\u2019s hand into keeping the Crown Princess under the care of the Hightowers as the North fought the worst Winter it had seen in recent memory. She would return the year before her eighteenth birthday to prepare her for her duties as heir and arrange a marriage for the future Queen. A year later, in 387 AC, she would be wed.\n\nOn the day it was discovered that Roslin Stark carried three children instead of one, House Stark rejoiced. With the North falling back into the fold and the beginning stages of the Kingdom of Winter\u2019s reparation being set into action, the future Queen\u2019s litter had been seen as a boon from the Old Gods - a reward for their struggle, and a sign of better times to come.\n\nBut the birth of three children almost killed the future Queen, and for three days and three nights she lay unconscious as the dregs of her House gathered around her to say their prayers and sit in fear if their boon had been refunded in full. She dreamed those three nights - indiscernible and terrifying, and the Crown Princess was unable to wake for those three days and three nights until she came to understand the dream.\n\nThe hot springs of Winterfell had been frozen over, and yet steam still bled from the furnaces of the world. It burned when she approached it, and yet she felt a chill all the same. She had felt that same chill and that same burn throughout the entirety of the Queen\u2019s dreams as a pain took hold of her and made her limbs coil up around her - but it was not her pain. What she was feeling was not hers to feel, and yet she felt it all the same.\n\nWhen the Crown Princess awoke she knew, not quite how or why, that Queen Sansa Stark, Second of her Name would die a slow and unfathomable death, burning and freezing and unable to stand. And she saw for herself a lifetime of infertility, of miscarriages and stillbirths and children that would never have come to be. Her labours had given Winterfell three Heirs, and yet it had brought house Stark eighteen years of dread.\n\nIt was to both her dismay and her dread that her dreams would be reality when she suffered her first miscarriage. Winterfell\u2019s Maester, a squat young man named Morgon, said it was to be expected. Triplets at only eighteen had ruined Roslin\u2019s body, and for the next eighteen years it had ruined her chances of conception.\n\nTwo years later, as the harsh Winter began to thaw, Queen Sansa called the Second Winter Embassy to reincorporate the North back into the fold of the Iron Throne. Despite being met with fierce opposition from the far-Northern Lords, a vote was called and concluded with Sansa bending the knee once more to the King on the Iron Throne. The North\u2019s formal reincorporation would not come until 390 AC, but upon Queen Sansa\u2019s return from swearing obeisance she had begun to show signs of Winter Fever - the fever that Roslin knew would take her life.\n\nDespite giving way to factionalism in the North, the Queen\u2019s plight was not for naught; The Kingdom of Winter had finally seen the last of the Winter Blight in 395 AC with the help of King Malwyn Tully, and for the next decade the North would finally begin to recover from the awful Winter it had endured.\n\nThroughout the year of 404 AC however Queen Sansa\u2019s illness had begun to take its toll on her. She fought, and valiantly, but as Roslin had seen and known there was no escaping the Queen\u2019s curious case of Winter Fever. She would be found dead in the Hot Springs of Winterfell, only two months before the turn of the year. With Roslin now Queen, her crowning had been pushed back to accommodate for a feast her aunt had originally been invited to, celebrating a century since the First Convocation.\n\n**Timeline**\n\n**369 AC:** Princess Roslin is born to Karlon Stark and Maeve Thenn. She never meets her father, as he dies fighting Wildlings.\n\n**370 AC:** King Alaric takes the throne after Queen Leona\u2019s death leaves a power vacuum in Winterfell. He pledges to rule until his eldest daughter Sansa comes of age.\n\n**375 AC:** King Alaric abdicates upon Queen Sansa II\u2019s sixteenth nameday. He retains his royal titles.\n\n**380 AC:** Roslin is sent to ward at Oldtown as the last of the Wildling skirmishes are cleaned up, where she learns much on religion and culture.\n\n**383 AC:** The Frozen years begin. Roslin remains at Oldtown for longer than she was intended to, though as a result she lives unaware of the horrors the North is facing until her return.\n\n**386 AC:** Roslin returns home to prepare for her eighteenth nameday the year later, and to take her place as Crown Princess.\n\n**387 AC:** Roslin marries and quickly falls pregnant. She gives birth to triplets, which nearly kills her. Her pain awakens her Greensight, where she foresees Queen Sansa\u2019s death as well as the years of infertility to follow. The Winter Blight begins, and Roslin comes to realise the horrors the North is facing first-hand.\n\n**389 AC:** Queen Sansa II calls the Second Winter Embassy as the Winter Blight ends, where a vote is held to bend the knee once more to the King on the Iron Throne. Sansa\u2019s plea succeeds, and over the next year or so preparations are made to reincorporate the North into the Seven Kingdoms.\n\n**390 AC:** Queen Sansa II formally bends the knee to King Malwyn Tully. When she returns to Winterfell, the first signs of the illness that would take her would begin to appear.\n\n**395 AC:** The Last of the Winter Blights end. For nearly a decade, the Crown Princess manages to live a relatively quiet life managing the day-to-day running of the Realm in her ailing Aunt\u2019s stead.\n\n**404 AC:** Towards the end of the year Queen Sansa II\u2019s illness finally takes her, and Roslin ascends to the Throne of Winter. Her Coronation, and Queen Sansa\u2019s funeral, are pushed back to accommodate for the feast celebrating a century since the First Convocation.\n\n**405 AC:** Roslin arrives at Riverrun.",

During the summer it was manageable but now when i\u2019m back at school it feels like hell. \n\nI\u2019ve tried \u2018 good sleep hygiene \u2018 which hasn\u2019t worked, meditation, mindfulness, and don\u2019t have any serious anxiety or worries more than a normal person. The only thing I haven\u2019t really tried is medication for this.(I also don\u2019t drink alcohol, caffeine etc anything that could keep me awake)\n\nI don\u2019t think my symptoms are too bad to be classified as insomnia and at the moment it\u2019s hard to get a doctors appointment -  has anyone else experienced this or know what could be causing it or to put an end to it? please help",

This should be played as a \\[2\\] -- zooming/rotating, moving allowed but external assistance is prohibited. Feel free to leave any walkthroughs in your comments, concealed with a >!spoiler tag.!<\n\nA bot will keep a leaderboard for the month. You'll notice two columns related to your scoring performance. The first of these columns is labeled **Average** and represents your average score among all games throughout the month. The second column is labeled **Score** and represents either: 1. The average of your top 15 performances, or 2. Your average score divided by 15 (if you have played less than 15 games). The leaderboard is sorted by Score. At the end of the month, the highest Score will be declared the winner, and the leaderboard will reset for the next month.\n\nWhy do we keep score this way? There were 3 potential options for scorekeeping:\n\n1. Straight Average -- flawed because a player who only plays once but scores 25000 would likely win for the month.\n2. Cumulative Total -- flawed because it unfairly favors those who are able to play every and is a severe disadvantage to those who miss even a single day.\n3. Score of top 15 -- the method currently in use, it allows for some leeway for those not able to play daily, but at the same time, it's beneficial to those who are able to play more than 15 times. After 15 plays, each new score will bump out the previous lowest score.\n\nThe Daily Challenge resets at midnight UTC, which coincides with the time that this post will go live each day.

I'm doing a double bachelor in Computer Science and Engineering and Applied Physics, I decided to do this because of my life long passion in CS, and a newfound interest in physics in my last year of highscool. Only now do I realise QC could be an interesting way to combine these two, so I'm thinking of taking some quantum elective courses this semester. I don't think I'll get much out of these quantum electives if I don't somewhat pursue QC. So I'm wondering how useful this combination of bachelors is in QC as I feel like physics really is 99% of QC (though i am not knowledgeable at all on QC). Thanks!",

The card game wasn't terrifically challenging; I lost only when the game forced me to lose for plot reasons. As a result, I think I rushed through the first part and missed some things. Then came the big rabbit hole reveal, and I was tickled to dive in. I went deeper and deeper, delighted at the trickly of secrets and lore.\n\nAnd then I reached the bottom of the rabbit hole. And there was nothing there. Roll credits. Tons of questions, virtually no answers. Incredibly unsatisfying.\n\nI learned that there was an ARG that players managed to decode ([explainer here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1x8ecQCktI), massive spoilers), and while I did notice some of the threads of it while I played, the depth and complexity of it is absolutely insane. Apparently, if you manage to follow *that* all the way down, you get to a lot of the answers that were missing from the game itself. Not all of them, but it does explain some of the big mysteries. Of course, it also raises even more questions.\n\nBut I'm not really willing to give a game credit for its ARG explaining things. A game needs to stand on its own. And I don't think this one did. It feels like a colossal missed opportunity. The gameplay is there, the mystery is there, but there's no payoff. It's like a mystery TV show that got canceled and they had to end it abruptly.\n\nUp until the end, I was ready to recommend this game wholeheartedly. But now I just can't. I'm glad I played it so that I know what people are talking about, but I wish I'd read a review like this one and then went and spoiled it for myself instead of playing it. At least it was short.",

Don't post your general questions & inquiries outside of this thread as they will be removed.\n\n#Lots of your questions have been answered already so make sure you do a search before asking (how-to below). \n\n---\n\nTo keep this subreddit tidy, we have this monthly thread that is open for random discussions and questions. **If you post your basic/general questions outside of this thread they will be removed.** Sorry, we want to make this sub friendly but also want it to be clean and organized.\n\nSome examples of the questions that should be posted here:\n\n- Questions that can be answered with just Yes/No\n- Basic questions like \"Where can I buy this?\"\n- Questions that were asked many times before. Please do your research\n- Questions that are not specific\n\n---\n\n##**Tips to quickly find answers for your questions:**\n\nMany of your questions may have been answered since people keep asking the same ones again and again. Here is a quick tip to find the answers for yours.\n\nFirst, [have a look at our old sticky threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3ASticky). A lot of useful information there. A lot of questions have been answered.\n\nYou can also use the search feature of Reddit, just like you do with Google.\n\nAnother option is to use Google, as Google understands your queries better than Reddit and can return better results.\n\nGo to Google. Add 'site:https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/' next to your queries (without quotes). For example, if I want to find info on eVisa in this subreddit, my query to put in Google is 'eVisa site:https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/'.\n\n---\n\n##**F.A.Q**\n\nHere are the common questions about travel/visa/living in Vietnam which have been answered by the community members, plus other useful information.

I've downloaded the Vizio mobile app but whenever I try to connect my TV to it, it says that no devices are able to be found. Also I read somewhere that an easy fix would be to connect a wireless USB Keyboard and mouse to my TV and and I would be able to set up the TV onto the network that way. Well I reset my TV by holding volume down and the input button at the same time for 10-15 seconds . And attempted to use my wireless USB Logitech keyboard and mouse but it's not showing or letting me control anything with those either. Any help would be greatly appreciated and hopefully I don't have to break down and end up getting s new replacement remote even though they're only like , $15 online....thanks in advance",

The more shares that are being traded, the higher the \u201cliquidity\u201d for that stock. Of course, the inverse is true: the \u201cliquidity\u201d of a stock falls with its volume. Here are the benefits of higher degrees of liquidity: Easy/quick order fills. If millions of shares are trading hands every day, it\u2019s probably going to be fairly easy to find a match for your full buy or sell order for a few thousand shares, and that match is probably going to happen rather quickly. Lower \u201cbid-ask spreads\u201d. The bid-ask spread is the difference between the highest buying bid and the lowest selling ask. The more shares that trade, the closer these two numbers tend to be, meaning that buyers and sellers are most likely to be getting a closer approximation of the stock\u2019s market value for any given trade. More price stability. This one is a little harder to see, since even the old-money heavyweights on the PSEi can be subjected to some pretty wild price swings due to index rebalancing or other external factors, but in theory, having a wider and deeper pool of potential buyers and sellers should result in swings that are less extreme or prone to manipulation.\r\n>    - ***MB:*** *Aside from the intense feelings that come with earning and losing real money, liquidity is the main difference between \u201cfun\u201d trading with fake data and real stock trading. When you take part in a trading contest that isn\u2019t constrained by a live order book, you can spend all of your theoretical \u20b110 million in fake trading money all at once to buy 6.58 million shares of PREIT at \u20b11.52/share, and that trade will \u201cfill\u201d instantly. Then, if the price ticks up a couple of centavos, you can instantly flick out of that trade entirely a couple of seconds later and be satisfied with that \u20b1131k profit. That\u2019s not how it works in the real world, especially for \u201coff the beaten path\u201d stocks like PREIT. A quick look at PREIT\u2019s historical data will show that a \u20b110 million order is usually around three times larger than an average day of PREIT trading. The order book is even less encouraging. I could enter a massive single order for all 6.66 million shares, but the lowest ask is \u20b11.52, and that\u2019s only for 4,000 shares. To get more than that I\u2019d need to raise my price to \u20b11.54, and even then, I\u2019m only adding 27,000 to my stack. There\u2019s a block of 1.089 million shares available at \u20b11.55, but if I buy that I\u2019m only around 11% of my way to the full order and my average price is already almost 2% higher than before I started. It can be just as frustrating (and sometimes worse) to sell out of an illiquid stock like PREIT, especially under circumstances that are less than ideal. It\u2019s a lot better when trading the megacaps like Ayala Corp, but even then, it can sometimes be challenging for funds to move in and out of large positions without driving the price up or down too much. A sophisticated player like a fund will actively manage its entries and exits over multiple days to try and gently \u201clayer\u201d the buys or sells into the natural flow of the market to try and minimize the impact of its own actions on the price. A fund might also go off the exchange and use a private placement or block sale to acquire a larger stake for a negotiated set price, or it might even go so far as to start a public tender offer to do the same to acquire a very large stake. In any case, those methods are all ways that the larger players use to avoid liquidity problems.*\r\n\r\n>- **[NOTES] Quick takes from around the market...**\r\n>    - **ACEN** [ACEN 5.01 \u25bc2.3%; 34% avgVol] preferred shares go live this morning. ACEN raised \u20b125 billion through the follow-on offering that was headlined by BDO Capital, BPI Capital, and China Bank Capital, with additional joint lead underwriters PNB Capital, RCBC Capital, and SB Capital. \r\n>       - ***MB Quick Take:*** *Aside from the obvious equity raise for ACEN that it can use to accelerate its RE build-out, this deal extends China Bank Capital\u2019s equity raise marketshare lead in the MB Underwriter League table for 2023 from 20% to 21%. The Underwriter League table has been updated! Check it out to see some of the big moves from this rather large transaction.*\r\n>    - **International Container** [ICT 207.20 \u25bc2.6%; 198% avgVol] [link] signed a US$ 750 million 6-year term loan with Metrobank [MBT 55.20 \u25b20.4%; 211% avgVol]. No rate information was disclosed. ICT will use the money to refinance some short-term debts and to \u201cfund strategic mergers and acquisitions\u201d. ICT is already the largest independent terminal operator in the world, and hopes that this loan will allow it to be more \u201cproactive\u201d with acquisitions \u201cof all sizes\u201d. \r\n>       - ***MB Quick Take:*** *ICT is one of the few truly global PH-based corporations on the PSE. It works in some of the trickiest jurisdictions, and weathers shifting political and strategic risks across cultures and through language barriers. ICT has nearly tripled since its COVID low back in 2020, and while the China \u201crecovery\u201d is starting to encounter some snags, it\u2019s not like global commerce is going to become any less interconnected over time. I\u2019m really curious to know what percentage of the proceeds of this loan will go to potential acquisitions.*\r\n>    - **RL Commercial REIT** [RCR 4.86 \u25bc7.8%; 4757% avgVol] [link] dropped 7.8% yesterday on over \u20b1312 million in value traded. All of the abnormal trades occurred at the end of the trading day. RCR didn\u2019t provide any explanation for the move. There were no notices of a block trade or other bulk trade on the PSE website. \r\n>       - ***MB Quick Take:*** *I don\u2019t really know what happened here. Is this a fat finger? A big rat jumping ship with insider info? Or just some big transaction that is being made quickly for reasons that have nothing to do with RCR at all?*\r\n\r\n**MB** is written and distributed every trading day.

    "selftext": "Hi All, long time lurker first time poster. I (M 40) have azoospermia. I also had an undescended right testicle by birth. After trying with my wife (F 34) we went to RMA NY. All my tests were normal. The doctor recommended TESE. Turns out my wife also had a low egg count. We were told that it would be better to do both TESE and egg retrieval on the same day. So my wife stared her IVF cycle based on the schedule provided. I was super nervous going in for TESE but luckily there were able to find sperm right away and got 8 vials. They were able to get 7 eggs from my wife out out of which 4 matured and were fertilized. Last week we found out that none of the eggs made it to blast. We were both devastated. My wife started crying as soon as we found out. I could bare the look on her face.\n\nAnyway we are trying to figure out the next steps. I have a few questions after this while process.\n\n1st, Should my doctor not know if my azoospermia obstructive or non obstructive? When I asked him,  he said it looks like it's obstructive cause they were able to find sperms right away but I thought it was odd that he dosen't know for sure.\n\n2nd, I asked my doctor if the eggs didn't make it to blast because of sperm issue? His response was he didn't know for sure,  if the sperm wasn't good, it wouldn't have been used and as far a he rememberthe sperm looked good. I feel odd again as I feel as a doctor shouldn't you read up on your patient's analysis before the follow up meeting. I am wondering also if I need to do anything to improve sperm quality for another TESE should it be needed. \n\n3rd, My wife asked her doctor if it was the sperm issue or the egg issue, her doctors response was that it common with low egg count that none of them make it to blast but she is also not sure what the real issue was. She thinks we should go for another IVF cycle with some changes in doses. \n\nI feel like after this first cycle we are even more confused than we were going in. We have not been provided any clarity from the doctor. I'd really appreciate any guidance or support from this group on what our next steps would be and if anyone else is in/was similar situation and how did they cope?",

    "selftext": "I read this series in what would have been the **mid to late 2000s**, I believe. (in the southeastern United States, if that helps.) It was about **a boy who was apprenticed to a witch hunter/monster hunter**. He and his master weren't really shown in a great light, like sometimes their actions were pretty questionable or cruel. I know there were ghosts and such that they had to banish. I remember that in the first or second book, **they help a girl (who was already a witch or was going to become one) and she ended up staying with them**, at least for a while.*Definitely* **dark medieval fantasy**. I remember imagining every scene as being **very dark**, as in only lit by torches or lanterns in the nighttime. The tone was also pretty **grim**, a lot of gross stuff happened and there wasn't much of a sense of hope.The most vivid part of my memory of this book series by far is the imagery on the covers. I've always loved medieval art, so the **authentic-looking woodcut print art on the covers** really caught my eye and stuck in my mind. They were also dark, **mostly black**. Not D\u00fcrer level of detail, maybe a little more **folk-arty**.I'm currently working on a dark medieval-fantasy monster-hunting rpg, and have been trying to rack my brain over this for months. It was such a distinctive moment in my creative development, and I would like to revisit it for inspiration and nostalgia. My mom says she vaguely remembers the books, but no one else I have spoken to remembers them, despite my siblings and friends and I reading mostly the same stuff growing up. Thank goodness this subreddit exists to help me figure out if I'm going crazy or not lol\n\nEDIT: Forgot to actually ask a question. Does anyone know the name of this series, and/or perhaps the author who created it?",

This is for people who are in the process of quitting sex, or for former sex addicts who want to stay sober.\n\nGoing public can help you strengthen your will.\n\nBeing sober means to be sex free:\n\n    To not watch porn\n    To not masturbate\n    To not edge\n    To not have sex, including karezza or similar things\n\nYou might not manage to honor your commitment. Relapses happen and it's OK, as long as you manage them. In this case, we simply would like you to mention the fact that your relapsed here.\n\nIf you happen to have sex, but with the honest intent of procreation (having a baby), this is of course not a relapse.\n\nThe reason we ask this is to give some weight to those commitments.\n\nGood luck, stay strong!",

There's not much more to it than that. It's just fun to compete and see how much you can read and improve between rounds!\n\nHere's an excerpt from Tadoku's \"Why Should I Participate?\":\n\n>Extensive reading of native materials is a great way to improve your understanding of the  language you're learning. There are many benefits to doing so: it builds vocabulary, reinforces grammar patterns, and you learn about the culture where your language is spoken. As you   participate in more rounds you will notice that you can read more and more as you improve. That said, it's not for everyone. Not everyone enjoys the process of immersing themselves. Tadoku isn't a magical pill that will make you fluent. It only covers extensive reading, and not extensive listening. While Tadoku is here to promote reading, a balanced approach to learning is still recommended.\n\n[If you're interested you can join here!](https://tadoku.app/ranking) Or read more [about the contest](https://tadoku.app/manual). \n\nGood luck everybody!\n\n*If you miss this round and want to try out the next one, the sixth and final round of the year starts a month  after this ends and goes from November 1st - 14th!* [*Full contest schedule*](https://tadoku.app/landing)*.*",

I live on the top floor of a three flat and after checking the building's security cam recording it is obvious no driver ever made a delivery to my building in that timeframe. The door to the building was open and the buzzer works. Will this be an issue when filing a claim? I have proof it was never delivered to my address and I never signed.   \n\n\nIt is also of note that I ordered a package (also ups) from the same store the week before.

She was obsessed with hand washing, no kisses for baby, don\u2019t touch the baby\u2019s face, etc. just a lot of nonsense. \n\nWell she went into labor, and I drove her to the hospital. Her mom meat us there and eventually we were all in the room together. I called my mom to tell her and she came to the hospital. It didn\u2019t make sense to keep my mom in the waiting room when this would probably take hours. My girlfriend said no and told my mom to get out, an argument between them soon followed and it resulted in my girlfriends mom physically removing my mom. Naturally I was upset, it\u2019s my child too and my mom has just as much right to be there. Around 30 minutes later my girlfriend was in active labor (We waited at home till her contractions were close, just adding this so the timeline makes sense) I went out and got my mom. This resulted in her having me and my mom removed from the room. I missed my own child\u2019s birth. \n\nAfter baby was here I was allowed back in, and my mom followed. I picked up baby and handed her to my mom. My mom gave her one small kiss on the cheek and my girlfriend lost her shit. She had my mom kicked out of the hospital all together and when I tried to defend my mom she had me kicked out aswell. \n\nShe went home with her mom and has been staying there, she\u2019s brought baby by once to get cloths and such. I think she\u2019s overreacting, it\u2019s my kid too and I should have just as much say so. \n\nHer parents have both told me I\u2019m a major AH, and I\u2019m only asking because her dad doesn\u2019t normally get involved, so I might be the AH.",

    "selftext": "So I've been toying with the idea of this crossover for a while now, and I booted up Destiny 2 for the third time this year and I feel inspired to finally give it a shot. Messages are largely pulled from Discord so I apologize if it is hard to read in some places. Also, note that Destiny is a game with an infinitely exponentially higher power ceiling than ASOIAF has (and technologically super lagging) so I won't just be able to 1:1 convert content, so I'm using the Warlord era as inspiration, with the various races slowly filtering in as time goes on. Since Destiny's lore has progressively worsened since The Witch Queen came out, I'm going to selectively ignore all the dumb stuff. Also not including guns and a lot of the more ontological threats. Sticking to bows, swords, and stuff of that nature.\n\nI'm both rubber ducky debugging and looking for feedback, feel free to weigh in. I've got no overlap in friends between ASOIAF Fanfics and Destiny nerds.\n\nI'm leaning away from having it take place during the main canon or earlier since a Guardian/ Lightbearer would completely trivialize any and all conflict. I feel like giving them the super honorable \"my duty is more important\" personality when they have godlike powers and no memories or life experiences doesn't click well, and kinda oppose to some of the game's themes.  *Maybe* I could make some of the characters there Guardians, but that just doesn't click with me.\n\nInstead, I'm thinking Planetos between 3 and 20 years following S8. I'd have the 7K broken and dissolved essentially into their constituent kingdoms, with Bran ruling \"de facto\" but having no real power. Not sure what to do with Bran/ 3EC, maybe a Speaker-type role, maybe something Clovid Bray adjacent. I want to incorporate Wish Dragons into the narrative somehow, so there's either an option there or with Jon. The Free Cities are also expanding and colonizing into Dothraki Sea but still a lot of raids going on from Dothrakai who were overall severely weakened.\n\n\nFor posterity, Guardians are basically immortal god-slaying super soldiers who are empowered in the \"Light\", a cosmic force that allows them to control reality as they will it (see what I mean about super OP?). To become a Guardian, you have to be chosen by a Ghost (little flying shell dudes) when you're dead. You'll lose your memories, but maintain your core personality. There are different levels of strength tied to how much plot armor you have too. It's never specifically said how they're chosen (There's a line about bravery inspiring devotion inspiring sacrifice), or how they choose their names/ ages, but they're usually in their physical prime. [Here's a trailer showing their powers.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XQwGIs3-v0)\n\n-------------\n##**Characters**\n\nI'd bring back random characters from ASOIAF history as the story progressed, in vague outlines for POVs I'm thinking:\n\n* Gregor Clegane (Guardian) - A Titan. I could either have him turn around and be nice, or just be a generic bad guy. I'm not sure but leaning the later.\n\n* Dany (Guardian) - Filling a Season of the Hunt Crow-type role where people remember her, some hate her, some love her and she's just confused. \n\n* Waymar Royce (Guardian) - A hunter, kind of an MC for the first few arcs. Shaw Hawn, generally a good dude vibes.\n\n* Jon (Guardian) - I think I want him to fill a joint role copying elements from Uldren in Forsaken and Clovis Bray's lore from Beyond Light. I re-watched the Forsaken Uldren cutscenes and he's got massive Show Jon vibes, even down to the dialogue being scarily applicable. He's filling a super minor role for the first few arcs, steadily becoming corrupted in the background until he takes a big role around arc 3. He's gonna be like Uldren with Stasis instead of the Scorn.\n\n* Chadmure - King of the Trident and all-around gigachad, trying to lead his quasi-independent kingdom forward through turmoil. Married to Roslin with 2+ children.\n\n* Additional undecided Human POV, taking suggestions. Also kinda considering reviving one of the Starks to fill in here.\n\nFor non-POV Characters I was planning on trying to mix in Guardians and regular dudes as important figures. Ghosts allow the potential to bring back random characters from Westerosi history which I think as a ton of potential for stuff as I go along. There's gonna be random Essosi figures here too.\n\n* Aegon I (Guardian) - True to his first life, he's trying to build his realm as a Warlord and quickly enters conflict with other Guardians.\n\n* Maester Aemon (Guardian) - Would definitely be a Warlock, keeps his kind personality and tries to help people and learn. Eventually would fall in with Dany, I think.\n\n* Maester Luwin (Guardian) - Another Warlock.,\n\n* Ramsay Snow (Guardian) - Cruel asshole\n\n* Robbyn Arryn \n\n* Brienne\n\n* Tyrion, maybe? I think he'd lose the West within a week so he's out imo.\n\n* Yohn Royce (Guardian)\n\n* Margaery Tyrell (Guardian) - She's gonna have big Efrideet vibes\n\n* Benedict Blackmont (Guardian)\n\n* Brandon Stark (Guardian) - Random Brandon, haven't decided.\n\n* Robb Stark (Guardian) - Undecided\n\n* Harwin Strong (Guardian)\n\n* Random Ironborn dudes (Guardians)\n\n* Humfrey Waters (Guardian)\n\n* Arthur Dayne (Guardian) - Should go without saying but he's using a sword.\n\n------\n\n##**Worldbuilding**\n\nWorldbuilding is what I'm most excited about. Obviously, Stasis (evil ice magic) will be tied to the Others north of the Wall. I'm not sure what to do with the CotF tho. I'm thinking about putting a [Darkness Statue](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1024/1*4Lw0DEocaH4yBeOIVLvBqQ.jpeg) at the heart of the Night King's frozen fortress that's shown once in the show and never touched on again.\n\nAdditionally, I'm going to tie the Oily Blackstone and the other \"Dark\" elements of ASOIAF to the Darkness statues. So we'll see them in Yeen, (probably not Valyria since I'm kinda planning on tying them to the Awoken), Asshai, the Hightower, Pyke, etc. I'm also planning on connecting Valyria to Forsaken-era dreaming city stuff, so there'll be a Scorn equivalent there. Yeen and Venus are both jungles, so I'm going to tie Yeen to the Vex which will probably be the first alien race explored.  No idea for the Hive, Fallen, Cabal, or Taken. There are the Tigerpeople from Destiny who were cut in early dev that can be tied to the Blood Stone Emperor's legend, but I'm not sure what to do there. \n\n----\n##**Story layout**\n\nSo I'm planning the narrative in arcs, I'll either publish it as one big story and highlight each arc as being relatively self-contained, or in smaller ones per arc. I'm not sure how I'm going to structure the fic, whether it'll be one POV/ chapter or multi-POV, but for the style I want to go for, I'm leaning toward the latter so I can have shorter POVs to really nail the effect I'm going for with Jon (and epic! events without it being weird). Also going to have random snippets of Destiny lore item text if they pertain to the chapter at the start/ end.\n\n**Arc One**\n\nOverall, the first arc would explore the worldbuilding aspect of how Planetos is impacted by godslaying immortal supersoldiers entering the scene.\n\n* Waymar's Arc begins the same way the game starts, a Ghost flies North of the Wall, scanning, and he finds a body. He revives it, and it's Waymar Royce (died in the AGOT prologue). First chapter or two of his is Waymar gaining control of his powers, dying to random predators and men as he learns. North of the Wall he comes across Jon Snow's hut, he hates the Ghost (the Voice Actor for the Ghost in Destiny at launch was Peter Dinklage), and says he has his own and pats Ghost. Threatens him and tells him to fuck off, and Waymar does. Ends at the remains of the Wall and explores the Northern realm to find Ramsay has risen with godlike powers and is being Ramsay.\n\n* Dany's arc begins with her waking up in the plains of Essos. As previously mentioned, she's filling a Crow style role where many people hate her, but a lot of people look up to and respect her. She's just confused. Early on she finds her way to a city (Selhorys I think), where she's *kinda* of recognized. It's still the early days of the Guardians rising, and the Red Priests think she's Azor Ahai reborn, she says she's not. Channeling first life Dany, she frees the slaves and helps the Red Temple. Find the first remnants of the Fallen here in her last chapter.\n\n* Gregor's arc is him waking up in the charred ruins of the Red Keep. He's going to have a kinda Crow like role as well, but he's ultimately going to be taken in service by a Lord (he's not much of a ruler) and he ultimately ends up usurping whoever he serves and becoming a War Lord, likely in the North of the Blackwater. He'll be in direct conflict with Aegon I, I think.\n\n* Chadmure is going to be trying to maintain his control over his Kingdom as the world around him changes. He's going to be political and show off his devotion, bravery, sacrifice. Trying to work with rather than against the Guardians for the good of all his people. There's some interaction with Robbyn Arryn I want to be here but I'm not sure where I'll do it.\n\n* Jon is going to be sad North of the Wall and see visions of Dany pushing him North. He ends up in the Fortress of solitude from the Night King and he ends the POV creating Ice walls (Stasis).\n\nSo basically building up the changes to the world as they happen.\n\n**Arc Two**\n\nArc two is dedicated to exploring the world and the mysteries posed by the Darkness statues. We'll see the Vex introduced in Yeen when Dany heads there.\n\n* Edmure's arc is going to be front and back-loaded. In the beginning, he's finding that the Riverlands and Reach are having many Warlords pop up and his kingdom is eroding. Gregor is conquering in the South, he leads a host against them and dies. In the final chapter of the arc we find out that Edmure is revived by a Ghost.\n\n* Dany needs to go to Yeen to investigate some kind of disturbance, finds the Vex and fights them after they grow angry, sees the cruelties of the other Guardians and may begin to voice her discontent towards them. Begins growing disenfranchised with the red priests\n\n* Jon only has a few POVs but he's readily going madder and madder, getting better with Stasis. He eventually gets his Barron equivalents in the form of Others/ Wights/ Stasis Fallen, not sure how I'm gonna do this yet. Ends \n\n* Gregor is going around being a villain, is eventually killed by Edric/ Arthur Dayne, Robb Stark, and Waymar.\n\n* Wamyar fights to save the North from Ramsay, trains other Guardians as they rise and asks them to be kind. Ends up befriending other Guardians somehow, probably killing Gregor.\n\n** Arc Three**\n\nArc Three is where I really want to get into it with connecting the characters. I'm planning to really lean into a Forsaken inspired plot. This is where I'm kinda running out of ideas, the POVs changed here so I'm likely introducing a new one. Jon will also likely be revived as a Crow type, since he does really meet the stuff they say.\n\n* Jon is going to just straight up Merc Waymar at the start. Waymar goes full Cayde 6, he's going full Uldren Forsaken delusions. He's using the Ghost fragment to open a gate in Valyria to try and \"bring back Dany\" but he really lets out either the Scorn or Hive. He dies at the end, ranting and raving and fully mad taking inspiration from Viserys 2's end. Robb helps beat him,\n\n* Edmure is essentially the MC energy here, Waymar having trained him. Whether this will be shown in chapters or not, IDK. Jon also just rules and slaughters people raising them as his wights, but they're closer to Scorn. Edmure fights them and ends up putting Jon down. Robb is with him through a lot of it.\n\n* Dany breaks with the Red Priests and ends up forming what's essentially the Iron Lords in Essos, breaking the yoke of the cruel lords. Falls in with the Edmure crowd at the end.\n\nSo here's what I've got so far. If you've got any feedback or questions let me know. Gonna start writing this once I finish the chapter I've already started for another fic.",

    "selftext": "I (24f) work at a restaurant. I have a coworker (let's call her Liz) who is in her 50s. She is a very sweet Peruvian woman. She told me she moved to America 2 years ago. English is her 2nd language and while she does know it, she is NOT fluent. She needs help reading things sometimes and if we use big words in front of her, she will not understand. She understands a lot of english for sure, but all basic stuff. She has a great work ethic, always smiling, always willing to help, she cares about everyone, she is nice, and kind of the work mom to a lot of people there. My issue is that she is constantly insulting everybody's weight.\nI did not realize that Liz was doing this until yesterday, as she is so, so nice, so it just seemed so unlike her. In the past, she's made comments to me like \"don't eat too much of that, you don't want to get fat\" or \"another one?\" If I was eating something she deemed unhealthy. I know how stupid it sounds, but because she's so nice, and because she isn't from here, I always chalked it up to maybe a cultural difference? Like maybe in Peru, that's something that was socially acceptable to say? Or maybe she meant something else, but because of her lack of English vocabulary, maybe it was coming off wrong? Idk. So I never thought too much of it. I also know I'm not fat. I'm 5'8\" and weigh exactly 160lbs. I go to the gym 5 days a week to gain muscle, so I am actually gaining weight, but it's all healthy and in muscle form. \nYesterday, however, I realized this is a bigger issue, because I found out that she says these sorts of things to everybody who she deems overweight. I was walking by her, not even doing anything, and she grabs my arm and says she wants to tell me something. She used her Google translate to tell me that I need to buy new pants, because the ones I wear to work don't suit my body well and I look fat in them. I kinda laughed awkwardly and explained that I'm in uniform, so there isn't much I can do about the pants. Then she grabbed some extra skin that I have on my stomach (most people in the world have extra skin on their stomach, even her!!!) And told me that men won't find me desirable with the fat and I need a new wardrobe and to watch what I eat. That really hurt, tbh. She did this in front of a couple other staff members, so when I awkwardly walked away, they told me that she has said similar things to them as well. Apparently one girl went to go grab a soda to drink and Liz told her she should drink water instead because her body can't handle more soda. I started asking around and confirmed that she's said these sorts of things to anybody who she thinks isn't the picture of skinny health.\nIdk what to do. Advice? We have gone to management. Management says that they don't think she means any harm by it and we should just laugh it off. But it does still hurt. One man asked her to please stop saying stuff to him a week or so ago, and apparently she told him ok, ok, then continued the next day, so I'm not sure if she fully understood the request. How do you politely tell a nice older woman that she's offending the entire staff and to please stfu so she can go back to being our work mom?",

The goal was to create something small and affordable, yet powerful.\n\nIt may be small, but it punches well above it 68g/2.4oz weight, and can hold its own against bigger, and more expensive grooveboxes.\n\nEase of use and a fast workflow were also an important design goal; menu-diving is kept to a minimum, and you don't have to scroll through parameter lists. The time from 0 to head-bobbing is kept as short as possible.\n\n[Free Beat](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChhR8q_5fC7p1ks3FqH9GPw) has done a [review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH67yKssdfk) of the unit, and [you can find out specs, docs, support, sound demos and more on the website](https://www.woovebox.com/).\n\nMany here are not a fan of KS campaigns, so I managed to self-fund a production run.

    "selftext": " \n\n4th year Dental Student here. Delivered interim immediate dentures around a month and a half ago and have constantly been facing problems and multiple adjustment/reline visits. Feel bad for this pt bc he is complaining of not being able to eat or drink anything. Did a soft reline on the upper at the 1 wk FU and both upper and lower denture felt stable (slightly excess VDO though). However, he has come in 3 more times since then for adjustments and he is still saying the denture feels \"loose\" even though clinically they look OK to me. Looking back I should have done a better job managing expectations since this is the pt's first time with dentures but confused on how to proceed.\n\nDo I do another soft reline, and if so, do I charge him for it?\n\nIs this common? Do all interim immediate dentures just suck?\n\nHow long should I wait before starting final dentures?",

I took my vet's advice the first and second time to take her to the groomer's more often and try expressing the glands myself but she just seems to be getting them more frequently. Last week her gland was infected and a bit inflamed but luckily not ruptured this time (I was worried it had because it swelled up so much overnight), the vet expressed it and gave her antibiotics.\nToday I notice the tell tale angry red spot on her behind which means one of her glands is filling up again. So I bring her in and since there's no groomer or vet open I tried to express them myself but when I looked at the wipe I noticed a tiny bit of blood, I checked her more closely and yep there's a hole. \nI can try and get her into the same vet tomorrow but they close right before I get off work and I don't know if I'll be able to leave early since I already got in trouble for taking off too much for when I was sick earlier this month. And the vet doesn't do overnight.\nDo I wait and see if the antibiotics take care of it? Should I just take her to the emergency vet?\nAnd what sort of solutions are there long term for this kind of problem? I hate seeing Kaya in discomfort like this.

You must also have a statement balance on your account in the month you are charged the annual fee or you will not receive the MLA annual fee credit.\n\n# Which Act Applies, SCRA or MLA?\n\nThe military benefits you receive on credit cards depend on when you establish or open the account.\n\nOpen account before active duty = SCRA\n\nOpen account while on active duty = MLA\n\nIf you apply for the account **prior** to active duty orders, you are eligible for Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) benefits while you are on active duty orders.\n\nIf you apply for the credit card account **while you are on active duty orders**, a Guard and Reservists on 30 day or greater active orders, or a dependent of an active duty servicemember, you are eligible for Military Lending Act (MLA) benefits while you are on active orders or a dependent of someone on active orders.\n\nThe banks and credit card companies may deny you SCRA benefits if you opened the account while on active duty. In that case, confirm they are applying MLA benefits and if they are not, check MLA database and then apply for MLA benefits.\n\n# SCRA & MLA Covered Borrowers Details\n\nTo qualify for SCRA benefits, the credit account **must be established before active duty orders start.**\n\nCovered borrowers of SCRA defined as:\n\n* Active duty US military on Title 10 orders in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Space Force, Marines, or Coast Guard\n* National Guard or Reservists on 30 day or greater active duty orders (such as Title 32, Title 10)\n* Public Health Service and NOAA Commissioned Officers\n\nTo qualify for MLA benefits, the credit account **must be established while your or your active duty sponsor is on active duty orders of greater than 30 days.**\n\nCovered borrowers of MLA are defined as:\n\n* Active duty member of the Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force, Space Force, or Coast Guard\n* Guard or Reservists on 30 day or greater active orders\n* A spouse or child dependent of an Active Duty member of the Armed Forces as defined in 38 USC 101(4) \n\n# Best Starter Credit Card\n\nCheck your credit score through your bank, [Credit Karma](https://www.creditkarma.com/), or [Credit Sesame](https://creditsesame.com).\n\nIf you don't have a credit score or your score is below 700, **start with a no annual fee credit card from USAA or Navy Federal Credit Union** **(NFCU)**. Or apply for a secured credit card from another military friendly bank or credit union. That should be your best option to build a higher credit score.\n\n# What Fees Are Waived Under MLA and SCRA?\n\n In general, the following fees are waived by Chase and American Express\n\n* **Annual Membership fees**\n* Authorized user fees\n* Overlimit fees\n* Late Payment fees\n* Returned Payment fees\n* Statement Copy Request fees\n\nAmerican Express and Chase are very cryptic in the benefits they actually provide under MLA or SCRA. Usually the customer service reps just read a script if you call and ask. This is not helpful and why we've collected this data here.\n\nIf you have additional data points, please share them, as this information is only as accurate as the data points we collect.\n\nIf you have any other questions on credit cards in the military, please comment below.\n\nReminder: no referral links or solicitation of referral links.",

My wife today caught his teacher yelling at him and my son when asked says his teacher yells at him often.\n\nThis teacher also frequently breaks down into tears and in general doesn't seem stable. She already diagnosed my son with autism after 3 days in her class and treats him differently. He's going to meet with a child psychologist but so far this psychologist and another are pretty horrified about what is going on. The diagnosis without their input, methods like calling on my son last etc.\n\nI'm working with the principal to get him into another class and following up, but not much progress there. In the meantime I'm looking for ways for my son to somehow survive this mentally. He either needs time to adjust unlike most of the other kids who went to preschool, or maybe there is something wrong with him, but the yelling thing just isn't helping.  Any tips?",

So he left me to wait 2 hours for him and told me his ex was coming.\n\nIt\u2019s quite a complicated situation because we are also colleagues in a small hospitality company. \nA year back we used to hook up and we didn\u2019t work out for many reasons, one of it was our moral compass and also him not being over his ex. \nSo he takes his ex to work all the time and we haven\u2019t been hooking up for as long as they were in contact again but I have been having a hard time walking on eggshells as not to overstep boundaries. He didn\u2019t want to tell her we used to date until they were completely officially together again.\n\nSo when I got wasted I slipped and told her we used to date, she got incredibly angry, I\u2019m not sure whether at him or me or maybe both. \nAll the while they\u2019ve been seeing eachother regularly for 4 months.\n\nI have to be honest I don\u2019t exactly remember what the context was but I know there was no bad intent on my part.\n\nWe will have a talk next week, so let me know AITA or is there nuance to it?",

    "selftext": "So I was in the Barrens killing harpies - annoying fuckers, that was my first mistake when you think about it - and I accidentally pulled two at once. No worries, it happens. Kill the first one, send my now close to death pet into the second. It stuns me with a tornado. Why is that stun so long? Seven damn whole seconds I'm stuck in that fucking tornado while it destroys my pet and then hits me a few times for good measure. I get out of the stun, pop a wing clip and a clutch healing pot and run like the bitch I am. Naturally another harpy takes this moment to respawn right in the direction I'm running and it decides I look like a delightful target so now I've got two chasing after me ~~and my wing clip is on CD~~ (eta: 0 IQ moment at 3am when writing this. I think my concussive shot was on CD and I was out of range for wing clip and I conflated the two). I'm like two hits from death when I finally lose aggro and the mobs leash back. I take a moment to calm my heart rate. This is fine. This is good. If I can just get a safe distance away (cause there's still harpies fucking everywhere) I can find a safe spot to sit and eat some food, res my pet - oh, there aren't any harpies in that direction, just a few striders, those are yellow, that should be fine -\n\nThey weren't yellow :)\n\nAll the fucking other striders I've seen in the Barrens up to that point were yellow, but these ones? These ones were red. Naturally :)\n\nSo yeah I narrowly escaped from harpies only to fuck around and find out with a couple of ornery plainstriders because in my post-panic adrenaline I didn't tab over to make sure they were passive. [RIP Saluna, the troll hunter, and her loyal boar Meatshield.](https://imgur.com/a/UHN2s6d) What a way for my first HC run to end. 10 hours down the drain. I'm salty as hell.\n\nBut I'm having a fucking blast lol.\n\n[Take 2!](https://imgur.com/a/5i2cRch)\n\n(Shoutout to Kemao, the tauren warrior who didn't say a word to me (I'm not 100% sure he spoke English) but partied up and followed me around like a personal bodyguard while I slaughtered tigers for like 20 god damn minutes looking for my last fur drop. You were a real one - hope you're not dead)\n\nETA: Okay I feel like I need to defend my honor a little cause I may be a moron but I'm not THAT big a moron - I know wing clip doesn't have a CD, I've raided as a hunter since Classic dropped in 2019, I have nameplates turned on *in combat* (which yes I will now change, I just didn't like the extra screen clutter and didn't think it was necessary) and my spells are ALL on my action bar, a couple of them are just macroed the way I'm used to them being for years (wing clip behind concussive shot for example). Gimme a break guys, I may not be hyper optimized but I'm at least *competent.* Usually :')",

I\u2019ll be honest and say I\u2019m not exactly sure what it is for (detecting carbon monoxide obviously, but I don\u2019t know where the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning comes from). I kind of thought it was something with the fact that some people run appliances like microwaves and stuff inside the car. \n\nMy initial question was, I\u2019m planning on using the fact that you can leave the Prius running, and have the AC on without the engine, being on the whole night to sleep on an air mattress in the back of it while I travel, but I remembered that other people who lived more full-time in their cars and carbon monoxide detectors. \n\nWhat is this for? I kind of assumed if the engine was ON, and the AC was flowing that I wouldn\u2019t need one but then some of what I saw online said something to the effect of \u201cunless you\u2019re leaving the engine running you don\u2019t need one\u201d haha.

He just said that I needed to do more.\n\n I asked him to do one load of laundry while he was home for a bit.  He pretty much said how dare you you are the one that needs to do more. \n\nI would ask him for reassurance. He said I was too needy at times and that he couldn\u2019t give me anymore then he was giving at that time. \n\nI would want to buy something. He would glare at me and say I had no money and wouldn\u2019t let me. I once went to get a grilled cheese because I was hungry and he just rolled his eyes and said I should have eaten earlier but I did I was just hungry.  \n\nI would ask for directions and he would say not to be stupid and that I knew where I was going.\n\nI would complain about a bad day because I had a really hard job.

Went went on some amazing adventures together. The first two years, were amazing. Not the last few months though. But the sad times were starting to outweigh the nice and loving near the end.\n\nThe reason he broke up with me is because he started his own business and is working 15 hours a day. When he broke up with me he told me I was amazing and not to tell anyone he was mean. Like he knew what he did. He is obsessed with success and is always chasing the next big thing or person.

    "selftext": "as the title says, im beginning to think i may be lactose intolerant. lately ive been having symptoms like nausea, diarrhea, stomach rumbling and gurgling, and such after drinking milk. its gotten to the point where i basically always feel nauseous (but not in the same way you do when you're sick? idk, its hard to explain). \n\nmy problem is, most of my safe foods include dairy. one of my favourite foods ever is cereal and i have it for breakfast every morning. i love cereal so much it quite literally got me out of one of my most depressive episodes. i also really love cheese. \n\nnow, my mother is a vegan, and ive tried her vegan substitutes like soy milk and vegan cheese and im not a big fan of them. i dont see myself being able to eat cereal without actual dairy milk in it. this goes for most of my safe foods, as well, and im sort of stuck at the moment.\n\ni know its a meme that most people with lactose intolerance just simply ignore it and still consume dairy and such, but my arfid is largely connected with my emetophobia (fear of throwing up), and while i have yet to throw up from consuming dairy, i would still rather avoid the nausea. idk what to do at this point. cutting out dairy from my diet would just legitimately be unsafe at the moment with how many safe foods i'd have to stop eating, and nothing to really replace them. im so stuck. anyone got any similar experiences? or any advice? im desperate at this point.

Describes himself as a \"super genius\".   Very loyal to ACME coporation, despite lack of quality.  Too proud for food stamps or othet entitlement benefits.  Probably unironically considera Ayn Rand a good author.  Believes the strong should eat the weak (see the episode *Operation:  Rabbit* where Wile list ways he is \"superior\" as reasons Bugs Bunny should surrender).  Libertarian who wastes his vote on Libertarian Party candidates.  Complains it is illegal to order an ACME child bride.\n\n-  Road Runner:  As a *road* runner, infrastructure is very important to him.  Voted for Trump on his promises to rebuild infrastructure; but, does give Biden credit for the *Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act*.\n\n- Elmer Fudd:  Kinda in his name...F.U.D.D.  who believes in the Second Admendent...to a point.  \"Why would I need an AW 15 to shoot as whaskly wabbit?\".  Reluctantly voted for Trump in 2016 (\"Mr. Twump is so mean.  Mexicans are great!  Speedy Gonzales mows my grass faster than those lazy entitles Millenials!\"); but, too the Pandemic as a chance to vote for Biden in 2020.\n\n- Yosmite Sam:  Calls both Bushes \"cuckservatives\".  Was on the Trump Train early.  Qanoner who drives a lifted rolling coal F-350 with a \"Fuck Biden* flag.  Pulls guns on ugly women entering the women's restroom to \"protect kids\".\n\n- Granny:  Lives off Social Security and a generous pension plan while begin against student loan affordable health care or college.  Attends school board meetings to complain about LGBTQ+ books in the highschool library.\n\n- Porky Pig:  Often a small business owner.  Took a PPP loan during lockdown but is mad about student loan forgivness.  Wears a bow tie.  Conservative who votes Republican.\n\n- Daffy Duck:  Too greedy to oay taxes.  Often often sports a gun despite being \"daffy\", so probably against gun control.  A small-government Republican with a \"no step on snek\" liscense plate.\n\n- Bugs Bunny:  Kinda like early Superman, often (*Homeless Hare*) conflicts with the wealthy (*Upswept Hare*  Bonus point for environmentalism and colonism) and banks (Barbary-Coast Bunny).  Would have supported Occupy Wallstreet.  Considers Democrats as too coporate; but, sees them as the lesser of two evils.",

If I'm sitting as still as possible (don't want to waste flushes and have toilet water all over me) it just goes off randomly while I'm sitting there, but when I get up (and \"clean up\") and go to wash my hands, it never flushes (and I have to do it manually; many people don't do it manually though and leave a mess)?!\n\nIt seems these toilets are programmed the wrong way. I don't know why they go off while you sit there and then refuse to flush automatically when you get up.\n\nJust wondering if you all have this same problem.",

We had s*x for the first time last week and it was extremely confusing. It was pretty easy to tell she wasn\u2019t enjoying it but kept telling me she was. Problem is 90% of the enjoyment I get from s*x is pleasuring the girl and making them c*m. \n\nSo we talked today and she explained how she was touched as a kid and physically can\u2019t get enjoyment from s*x. She explained how she still wants it and enjoys me but she just can\u2019t c*m from it. She said she can get off with a vibrator. I don\u2019t know what to do at this point. \n\nI really like her but I can\u2019t have s*x with her if she can\u2019t enjoy it bc I just feel weird and don\u2019t enjoy it. S*x isn\u2019t everything, I know that. But to me it\u2019s an important part of a relationship.\n\nTL;DR :\nGf can\u2019t physically enjoy intercourse and I don\u2019t know what to do.",

They rely on owner pilots to volunteer themselves and their aircraft to give these children a day to remember. Since it is a volunteer event recognized by the FAA any licensed pilot, (even PPL) with an aircraft can participate.\n\nI participated in this event last year, and it was one of the most rewarding things I have done since buying my Warrior, I received this nice plaque in thanks, but the joy brought to these children is reward enough. You don't get paid, but you are provided with a catered lunch, and all airport fees are waived. You are also able to buy 100LL at or below cost.\n\nI am planning to participate again this year and looking forward to it. I wanted to post about this event and raise awareness of this excellent program, and maybe even recruit more volunteers.\n\nIf you are based anywhere near HSV you should consider participating in this worthy event. Even if you don't have an aircraft to provide, they still need ground crew and other volunteers.\n\nTheir website is at: https://flyquest.org/kidsday/",

    "selftext": "so to set the stage, this was back in march, the year of our lord 2023. I was in a brand new relationship (for 2 months or so) and this is the first woman i've ever met in my life that was also a vidga game enjoyer, her fav genre was RPGs which mine is too, match made in heaven)\n\nWell, she is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened to me, when she's not screaming, putting hands on me, or threatening to cheat on me. She always apologizes and says it won't happen again but i know it will. I like it, keeps me on my toes. What did Forest Gump say again?\n\nAnyway, our new relationship was going quite swell and we decided we would do the next most obvious thing a new and in love couple would do, get married. Just kidding, we took illegal schedule 1 substances together. Maybe not our greatest decision, but as the late great Salvador Dali said, I am drugs.\n\nA brand new quest had been released on Runescape just a few days before i could finish the last quest remaining on my ironman to achieve the coveted quest cape. Song of The Elves was soon dethroned and a new menace was revealed, Secrets of the North.\n\nI tried to beat this boss close to 10 times throughout the day. some of the phrases mustered during this time were:\n\n\"This is fucking crazy\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"how am i beating grandmaster quests and getting dunked on by shriveled chodes\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"What is this fucking rs3 bullshit\" At the sight of a Soulsplit phase on the boss.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNeedless to say, i was defeated. I absconded back into the catacombs of kourend, relegated to having to raise my skills despite knocking out some of the hardest quests in the game. That is, until I took the shrooms and they kicked in. The warm fuzzy feeling of the pre-trip put a little  juice in my croissant, and i was ready to give this boss one final go.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was my character. i didn't see the game as runescape anymore, i saw it as a grid and numbers, a mathematical equation to be solved.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI dismantled the bosses oppressive establishment board by board, stumbled my way back to the wise old man, got my fucking cape and cried. I wasn't crying about getting the cape, i was crying because of how much in that moment i loved my life. It had nothing to do with the game, it was like an angel was giving me a temple massage while letting me smell her feet\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI did the quest cape emote once, logged off, and me and my girlfriend went and melted in the bed. While holding her in the dark it felt like she was Richelle Ryan, my dream woman. Her average sized and child-nurturing breasts were perky DDs, and her lips felt like jesus christ himself. Unfortunately in that moment, my tool was about as useful as a bronze dagger, with an agility debuff to boot. Needless to say, i tried anyway. She needed Torags Hammer, and I was Veracs Flail. After about an hour and a half of poking her with the equivalent of a chinese finger trap, we decided a proper rain check was in order. The blue ball on my new quest cape already had more peers in it's life than i did, a sad reality.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStill one of the best nights ever. I love runescape. DT2 took my quest cape away\n\n&#x200B;",

    "selftext": "Hi All, long time lurker first time poster. I (M 40) have azoospermia. I also had an undescended right testicle by birth. After trying with my wife (F 34) we went to RMA NY. All my tests were normal. The doctor recommended TESE. Turns out my wife also had a low egg count. We were told that it would be better to do both TESE and egg retrieval on the same day. So my wife stared her IVF cycle based on the schedule provided. I was super nervous going in for TESE but luckily there were able to find sperm right away and got 8 vials. They were able to get 7 eggs from my wife out out of which 4 matured and were fertilized. Last week we found out that none of the eggs made it to blast. We were both devastated. My wife started crying as soon as we found out. I could bare the look on her face.\n\nAnyway we are trying to figure out the next steps. I have a few questions after this while process.\n\n1st, Should my doctor not know if my azoospermia obstructive or non obstructive? When I asked him,  he said it looks like it's obstructive cause they were able to find sperms right away but I thought it was odd that he dosen't know for sure.\n\n2nd, I asked my doctor if the eggs didn't make it to blast because of sperm issue? His response was he didn't know for sure,  if the sperm wasn't good, it wouldn't have been used and as far a he rememberthe sperm looked good. I feel odd again as I feel as a doctor shouldn't you read up on your patient's analysis before the follow up meeting. I am wondering also if I need to do anything to improve sperm quality for another TESE should it be needed. \n\n3rd, My wife asked her doctor if it was the sperm issue or the egg issue, her doctors response was that it common with low egg count that none of them make it to blast but she is also not sure what the real issue was. She thinks we should go for another IVF cycle with some changes in doses. \n\nI feel like after this first cycle we are even more confused than we were going in. We have not been provided any clarity from the doctor. I'd really appreciate any guidance or support from this group on what our next steps would be and if anyone else is in/was similar situation and how did they cope?",

    "selftext": "Hello Reddit. I was just doing some research on the movie \u201cHellraiser\u201d and it\u2019s Hulu show, and I seen an old post about the order and a bunch of stuff around it. And as someone who has really never watched ANY Horror movies (only one I think I\u2019ve seen is Grave Encounters which at the time gave me a panic attack lmao). I wanted to ask what are some ESSENTIAL Movies within horror that I should see or look into. I also bought \u201cIt\u201d by SK on paperback (I enjoy reading and I heard his books are a multiverse, the dark tower, and I love deep diving into large concepts like that) but I also never seen the movies for the book either.\n\nI know horror is a huge thing for some people, I just got put off on it cause when I saw grave encounters at the age of like 9, yea that shit had me freaking the fuck out cause it felt too real, lol. But i don\u2019t know I\u2019m tryna broaden my interests and knowledge on things, legit make a list in the comments of anything I should watch, and I\u2019ll write them down. \n\nAlso, I saw hellraiser has a shit ton of sequels, are they all necessary to watch? Or is it a \u201cWatch the first and you\u2019re good\u201d type deal? Cause the Hulu show looks interesting so I wanted to look into that.\n\nThank you",

If you\u2019re a hikikomori no one is gonna look at your shit if you email it. You walk into a business and you hand them your resume shake their hand and walk out and do that about 40 times. Congratulations you now have a job it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s minimum wage just get to work. The key is to leave your work on good terms for a good reference. Every 6 months to 2 years you want to take a 10 percent pay rise and show up every day for work. If you call in sick more than twice in a month, your work place probably hates you. Now for friends you need at least 2 good friends in life ,so start going out for walks to get your self comfortable with being outside of your hole. Now is the tricky bit joining classes or activities go online and find something, anything from yoga to supersmash bros tournaments it costs money yes but it\u2019s really not much and it\u2019s really not hard. \nPoint is you don\u2019t want to be a stinky loner that no one likes just by looking at you because can tell also take a shower",

Sometimes I can't even pay attention when the teacher explains a topic. The thoughts in my head are making me crazy. Most of the time I feel like there are a lot of voices in my head talking at the same time 24/7. When I interact with someone (a classmate or a teacher) I become very awkward and my mind goes blank. That's why I literally have no friends. I also never feel comfortable, I always feel there's something wrong. I feel everyone is looking at me. I feel everyone hates me. SHIT.\n\nAt least when I get home from school, things become a bit calm for me, but still, the thoughts are still there and I don't know if I can do this anymore. I don't want to go. I don't know what to do. I'm in the process of getting a therapist but you know those things take time. I seriously don't know how to continue. ",

I wasn\u2019t very happy with the night. Later on in the night I saw her friend spanking her, touching her, and motor boating her. I felt angry. My girlfriend is bisexual and so is her friend. I had strong emotions about the situation. \n\nIt\u2019s a early relationship, no more than 2 months. I like this woman, but I felt wronged by the situation. It shouldn\u2019t matter if a woman or guy does this. She doesn\u2019t remember that night because she got completely wasted, but her friend does. It\u2019s wrong either way right?

This is Lead Ranger Kor'Os of the Hazeborn.\"\n\n\"Court?\" Kor'Os asked curiously from where she was writing in her journal. Despite it still being early morning she was already wearing her leather armored uniform. \"Is that what you think we've been doing?\" She asked. \"I just thought we were fucking. I didn't realize you wanted it to go that far.\"\n\nArtair's shoulders slumped as he looked at her in the reflection of his mirror, where he was using a set of snips to keep his beard trimmed.\n\n\"Kor.\" He whined. \"We talked about this. The only reason we were going to the Krag was so I could meet your Clan Father.\"\n\n\"I thought that was just because you wanted to ask forgiveness for taking me from my duties.\" She said without looking up from her journal. \"I'm supposed to be a scout commander.\" She reminded him. \n\nArtair simply stared at her, the little scissors paused mid shear.\n\nBut he saw the little smirk at the corner of her mouth.\n\n\"You're messing with me.\" He said in annoyance.\n\n\"Have been for about eight months now.\" She said before looking up and sticking her tongue out at him.  He returned the gesture in kind.\n\n\"Gods why do I like you?\" He asked silently.\n\n\"Because you have a weird domination thing going on and you've yet to beat me in a fight?\" She mused. \"Or maybe its because you see in me someone who actually upholds the code of the Petravian Army to the very heart of their being. And you wish to be close to them so you can learn what true responsibility and duty are like.\"\n\n\"Firstly, that's not even remotely accurate.\" He said as he held the scissors up and pointed them at her. \"Second, I've beat you twice now.\"\n\n\"Out of fourteen duels.\" She said under her breath. But he ignored it.  \n\n\"Third, If I really wanted someone like that I would just hang out with my army loving sister and uncle. And in case you haven't noticed, I make a point of avoiding both the capital AND Jadesport.\" He said as he turned and went back to his grooming. \"Lastly, that's just rude.\"\n\n\"Leave your goatee long.\" She said as she saw the scissors move near it out of the corner of her eye. \"You know I like it longer.\"\n\nWithout even thinking Artair moved the scissors to the other side of his mouth, skipping the area she'd mentioned. Then he paused and looked at them as he realized what had just happened.\n\nKor'Os lifted the map she'd been comparing her notes to so that it covered the grin on her face as he tried to look at her in the mirror again.\n\n\\-------------------------------\n\nJames and Amina were both beaming as they stood on the small berm around the construction site.\n\n\"James this is a beautiful site.\" Amina said as she leaned her head against his. \n\n\"Don't thank me for that.\" He said honestly as he leaned into her. \"Jurl chose this spot. Or it was just the only chunk of land that could be bought. I don't actually know how property laws work here.\" He said as he looked around. \"Do people own this area?\"\n\nAround them the rain forest near the hot springs was alive with noise and motion as the animals of the land. And in front of them a large group of people were moving supplies in and out of the clearing. there was already a foundation laid down. And some of the workers were using magic to quickly secure strong wooden beams, that looked as if they'd been burned somewhat, into the stone before solidifying it.\n\nAnother one of the workers, wearing gear that looked more like a mages than a craftsman's, was moving a large bubble of water from the nearby springs through a series of meshes that filtered out bits of detritus and sediment. Then they placed the water into something that looked akin to a diagram James had seen once of a makeshift water filter. That filter then poured the water into a massive copper basin that was set into the stone and had a cover over most of it. He assumed it would go on to become their water tank.\n\nOff to the sides and behind the building were several massive piles of various sized boulders and rocks, as well as large containers that appeared to be filled with sand. James imagined that they would eventually become the walls that would surround the compound and be infused with enchantments and runes to keep intruders out.\n\n\"James how much did all this cost?\" She asked as she looked at the wagon that was still ambling down the road they'd ridden down toward the construction site. \"This must have been a lot.\"\n\nHe nodded. \"It was. But, according to the royal bank I still have plenty to spare.\" He shrugged a bit. \"Between the elementals, the stipend I get as the summoned hero, and even coming in as a disqualified third place in the tournament. I'm... still pretty well off.\"\n\n\"Personally.\" Jurl said as he walked up behind them with a round case that he was pulling some rolled parchments out of. \"I think James is being conservative given the location. And I wholeheartedly approve.\" He said as he selected one of the rolls and put the others back. A moment later he was holding the sketch that was on it up so that they could compare it to the current progress. \"I've never been as big on ostentation as my partners in the company are. Understated is best.\"\n\n\"Four buildings?\" Amina asked curiously. \"I thought it was only one.\"\n\n\"Eh. Hindsight and revisions.\" James said. \"In the original plans I forgot that we needed a spot for Steve.\" He admitted. He was actually a little ashamed of that fact. \"Then I remembered that you now have a griffin nearly the same size and that the two of them probably don't wanna be roommates. So a second one was needed.\" He dipped his head a bit as he pursed his lips. \"And the last ACTUAL house is for my mom. Or anyone who wants to visit and stay overnight. Or... whatever.\" He said flippantly.\n\n\"Your mother's not going to live with us?\" She asked in surprise as Jurl then moved over near one of the tables and replaced the sketch with some of his blueprints. He knew this was a couple's conversation and he wasn't needed for it.\n\n\"I thought about it.\" James replied. \"But with Veliry almost definitely not leaving the castle, or at least the capital. And with my mom well on her way to being one of the castle's lead healers? No way. We'll probably only see her for weekends and holidays.\"\n\n\"I kind of thought she'd come out here with us.\" Amina said with a slight pout. \"I guess you're right though.\"\n\n\"She'll probably try.\" James agreed. \"But... give her a month or two with nothing to do except baby stuff and she'll be pulling her hair out.\" Then he thought. \"Plus she hates humidity.... and bugs. This place will drive her wild.\"\n\n\"Mmm. That's probably true.\" Amina agreed. Mrs. Choi had never seemed like the one to sit on her hands for too long.\n\n\"If you guys would like.\" Jurl said, grabbing their attention. \"There's some tents and things down near the springs. They're for the crew, but we always have a few spares set up for the people that don't stay there full time.\"\n\n\"We did bring bathing suits.\" James said. \"And my mom does have the twins and the pups for the rest of the day as long as we get back in time. And Glag's keeping em safe.\"\n\nAmina did not need to be told twice.\n\nNor did Steve, who quickly followed behind, and eagerly jumped in the water like he had so long ago.\n\n\\------------------\n\nKing Farrick sat in the conference room with a glass of wine and both of his Arch Mages present.\n\nAs soon as the screen turned on with the face of the Colonel he sat up straighter and pushed the glass away.\n\n\"Your majesty.\" She said with a nod. \"The President will be on in just a few seconds.\"\n\nHe nodded back. He knew from James, Vickers, and the Ambassador, that the President was a busy man even by world leader standards. It actually made him somewhat glad that communication in his world was slow compared to on Earth. He could always tolerate LESS paperwork, and it seemed that constant information flow was the enemy of that concept.\n\nSure enough, a few moments later the screen switched over and showed the president sitting in a plush white chair. It was obvious that he wasn't in the same location as the Colonel.\n\n\"Your Majesty.\" He said in that smooth voice he had. \"How can I help you today?\" He asked.\n\nThe translation software on the communication hub had been updated repeatedly over the past few years, and now the words that came out of the machine were in fluent Petravian to the King's ears. Though it did cause a discomforting phenomena that James had referred to as Bad-Dub-Mouth.\n\n\"Good afternoon Mr. President.\" King Farrick said. Then he braced himself for what was no doubt going to be a very long conversation that would never be allowed to leave either of the rooms they were in. \"I came to tell you about a little... technological development that my people have been working on for quite some time now.\"\n\nThe president sat up straighter in his chair, suddenly aware of the seriousness of the conversation. Something occurred with the room he was in and the glass of water on his table slid a bit as he bobbed up and down for a moment. The king ignored the way the two mages looked at each other curiously at that.\n\n\"Oh?\" The President said in mild surprise. \"And what's that?\"\n\nFarrick could see the hunger hidden right behind the calm facade that his rival was wearing. Were he less experienced in this game he might have shown discomfort, or perhaps second guessed the plan he had.\n\nBut he knew what he was doing.\n\n\"Well.\" He began. \"We believe we may have figured out a way to open the path between our worlds again.\" At that the president was completely upright in his seat and his eyes were rapt with curiousity. \n\nThen the King lied. \"And we believe we may be at the point where testing it is necessary.\"\n\n\\-------------------------\n\nWhen Samantha first entered Fletcher's office to watch the news they tried sitting next to each other behind his desk, pulling one of the chairs from in front of the desk around so she could sit in it.\n\nBut her legs were too long and she was just a bit too wide for both of them to squeeze in there at the same time.\n\nSo she'd done the bold thing and attempted to sit in his lap, with her arms around his shoulder.\n\nThen she'd been painfully reminded, mainly by his subtle squirms and grunts of discomfort, that she was much heavier than she used to be.\n\nSo they'd changed seating one more time.\n\n\"This feels...... awkward.\" He said as he sat on HER lap instead. On his computer screen was the main K-Span channel that ran international news of the non-political variety.\n\n\"Are you uncomfortable Mr. Fletcher?\" She asked in amusement. \"Is my fur not soft enough for your, admittedly well sculpted, butt to sit on?\"\n\nHe looked back at her with mock upset on his face.\n\n\"Noooo.\" He said sarcastically. \"It's just... this is backwards and its messing with me.\" He admitted. \"Also thank you.\"\n\n\"For what?\" She asked, amused.\n\n\"The comment about my butt.\" He said with no shame. \"I work hard riding my bike to get it that way.\"\n\n\"Oh god.\" She said with fake horror. \"I'm dating a guy who rides a bike to work.\"\n\n\"I don't ride it to work.\" He said. \"I just use it for cardio every now and then. Also squats. Super clutch. Now shut up it's about to restart.\" He added as he pointed at his screen and settled back against her.\n\nShe chuckled as he squirmed a bit to try to get comfortable.\n\n*\"Good evening viewers I'm Donny Greenburg with K-Span stream-five news. CRAZY images coming from Sturgis today as WEREWOLVES were spotted, seemingly unattended, as they roamed the main street of the city. People have been posting images and videos of the wolves shopping, eating at one of the local buffets, interacting with children, and even getting some time in on a basketball court with some of the townspeople of Sturgis.\"*\n\nAs the host spoke, images from the day's trip popped up on the screen next to him. She recognized the images of her in the plus size boutique, an image of Brighton comparing jerseys with the little boy while Ngoko scarfed down a slice of pizza behind them, and of course the group photo from the court.\n\n\"The bit with the kid was kinda cute if you ignore the mom.\" Fletcher said. The motion of him turning to look at her put his mouth close to her ear, and his breath made the little hairs in it tickle a bit.\n\n\"Eh, she was a jerk.\" She agreed. \"But Brighton did good. And honestly, I think he was just being himself.\"\n\n\"Well.\" Fletcher said. \"That's what you were trying to show people.\"\n\n*\"Now the comments and posts about this whole thing have been NON-STOP.\"* Greenburg said. *\"Some people are upset that the wolves seemed to be left to their own devices and running amok. But others have countered that at several points throughout the little field trip several undercover members of the SPD were seen keeping a sort of loose cordon around them. Though it did get a little relaxed during the basketball game.\"* A clip of Bishop taking the ball to the hoop played for a few seconds. *\"But I mean, can you blame em?\"* Greenburg asked*. \"Look at that slam dunk. Now sure there have been some naysayers out there. But as reports and streams and posts have been flooding in, it's become clear that apparently nobody was hurt during this event.\"* Another clip of the basketball game played, this one showing Lopez casually slipping past two of the defenders with the basketball. *\"Except maybe for those guys ankles!\"*\n\n\"Jesus.\" Fletcher said as he watched the basketball footage seemingly for the first time. \"Look at those moves.\"\n\n\"That's Lopez.\" She said. \"I guess he's a bit of an athlete.\"\n\n\"I'll say.\" He replied.\n\n*\"Now this has, somewhat inevitably, raised the question. Given the speech given by Samantha Jenkins at the town hall. Given the announcement by the American and Canadian C.U.N. representatives. Given this little outing- and be tasteful guys, they are PEOPLE, I'm not gonna call it walkies like so many of you are calling it.\"*\n\nSamantha looked at Fletcher with an eyebrow raised.\n\n\"What?\" He asked. \"It's not like I called it that.\"\n\n\"People are calling it walkies?\" She asked rhetorically. \"Rude.\"\n\n\"You guys are KINDA... canines.\" He raised a finger defensively as he saw her readying to speak. \"You know I say that from a technical standpoint. He is right though.\" He said as he turned the finger to point at the screen. \"PEOPLE TOO.\"\n\nShe shook her head in annoyance.\n\n*\"But given the nature of these announcements. These public speeches and addresses by members of our OWN government.\"* Greenburg said as he put one hand in his pocket and used the other hand to gesticulate. *\"Are the werewolves currently being cared for by the city of Sturgis REALLY a threat to the town and its people? Or for that matter... any of us?\"* He put his hand in his other pocket*. \"Or are they just people who've gotten a rough shake of things and are making the most of it? We'll take a deeper dive into that, as well as talk to a few people who were AT some of these events. All that right after a word from our sponsors.\"*\n\nAnd just like that the video was cut off by an add for a product that could apparently clean anything off of anything. \n\nSamantha reached around Fletcher and took control to scroll down the webpage and looked at the comments. Most of them were fairly positive. But there were definitely some that were negative and called her and the other pack members some pretty foul things.\n\nAnd down at the bottom were some that she was fairly certain were going to result in some IP's being tracked for a little while.\n\n\"Don't worry about the comments.\" Fletcher said as he put his hand over the one she was using the mouse with. \"NEVER go to the comment section. It's never good down there.\"\n\nShe tilted her head a bit as his breath once again tickled the inside of her ear.\n\n\"You okay?\" He asked curiously. \"It's not that ba-\"\n\n\"It just tickles when you talk directly into my ear like that you dork.\" She said as she turned back toward him. \"I know the comments are....\"\n\nAnd suddenly they were both very aware of just how close the seating arrangement had made them.\n\n\"Just a bunch of idiots.\" She finished as she looked him in the eyes.\n\n***MATE!*** That annoying voice in her head demanded as she looked at his lips and unknowingly licked her own.\n\nFletcher's own face flared with a blush as he realized how she was looking at him.\n\n\"Do you think,\" She began uncertainly, her voice cracked for just a second. \"that we cou-\"\n\nHe answered before she could even finish the question. Pulling her snout towards his face and kissing her on the lips. Her arms, which were still around him to use the computer, pulled back and pulled him in as she kissed him back.\n\nBefore she realized what was happening her mouth was almost enclosed around his whole face as their tongues wrestled with each other.\n\nHe seemed to notice the uniqueness of the kiss at almost the same time as she did as they both pushed away a bit and broke the kiss.\n\n\"Sorry.\" She said at the same time as he spoke.\n\n\"That was..... new.\" He said.\n\n\"That was all the instincts. I'm so sorry.\" She repeated.\n\n\"It's fine.\" He said as he wiped her saliva off of his cheeks. \"Let's um.\" He rubbed his hand on his shirt before beginning to wipe again. \"Let's try again. And uh... this time maybe try NOT... to devour me in the process.\" He said with a chuckle. \"I don't think the Kleenexes over there are gonna be enough to save me if you do it like that again.\" He said with a nod at the little napkin dispenser across the room.\n\n\"You wanna try again?\" She asked, completely missing the joke in favor of what her mind was interpreting as amazing news.\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\"Gonna have to get used to it at some point.\" He said with a grin. \n\nShe was pressing her face into his before he could begin speaking again.\n\nThis time she MOSTLY succeeded at keeping her mouth shut.",

    "selftext": "Baby is 7 months old. He has asked several times, \"what is wrong with her?\", I always tell him nothing's wrong, she's just a baby who doesn't sleep well. But now I'm starting to wonder myself if she is not normal...? \n\nFor context, when she was born I spent 2 months in and out of the hospital. I was away from her for an entire week on 2 separate occasions, and the rest of the time was hit or miss. My husband, parents, and in laws all took care of her and her sleep routine was absolutely nonexistent what with me nearly dying and everyone pitching in as best as they could. One night, she'd sleep in my mom's arms, the next night she'd sleep half in her bassinet and half with dad, then my mother in law came and had her every night for a week, etc. \n\nWhen I came home for good from the hospital, I started a consistent routine for her. Diaper change, pajamas/sleep sack, reading books, fan on, white noise, nurse to sleep, etc. This worked well until the 4 month regression and ever since then she has just hated being put down. I started cosleeping out of desperation, but her rooting for my nipple all night long absolutely broke me. I think I started losing my mind from how exhausted and touched out i was from pretty much 24 hours of contact with her. \n\nSo, I caved to trying a modified sleep training one night but never could let her cry for any longer than 4-5 minutes at a time and quickly gave up on it. I found success with transferring her finally and on most nights, can get her to sleep in her crib with about 20 minutes of patting, support, etc. but then she wakes up inevitably within 10-45 minutes of being put down?? Sometimes she'll do 2-3 hours but that's like a miracle. Usually, after like the 5th or 6th 20-minute resettle including topping up with milk, I give up and sleep with her on the floor bed in her nursery. Some nights I can just tell she is not going to let me settle her in the crib. She lets out the most devastating sobs and when that happens, I just surrender to a full night of cosleeping. \n\nI actually like cosleeping, but just not all night. For my sanity I need some time with her sleeping alone in her crib. I'm willing to stand over the crib and pat and sing and do whatever to help her. I just need to know, is this normal? To sometimes have your baby scream like she's being absolutely tortured the second you put her down? To not get longer than like 2 or 3 hours, at BEST, at 7 months?? \n\nI have this (irrational?) fear that she is so clingy for me because of the early separation we had when I was hospitalized. (She doesn't want her dad at night, just me.) She also was just diagnosed with tongue/lip ties which I'm not sure what I'll do about yet but I wonder if that can be affecting her sleep. \n\nIt's just SO FRUSTRATING to have almost every single person in my life telling me just to sleep train. Whyyyyy does everyone push SO damn hard for it?? My husband is wonderfully supportive and goes along with whatever plan I make in regards to her sleep, but all of our friends sleep trained so he has a bunch of dad friends with babies who sleep 10-11 hours at a time and that makes it harder. \n\nSorry this turned out so long. thank you for any advice or stories to help me feel better. I'm just so tired, and I love my daughter so much and don't want her to ever suffer but her needs are causing me suffering now and it's just a hard balance to strike, sacrificing for your child but also taking care of yourself.

Even when I work them out to get them stronger, they tense and become even more tight. I\u2019ve had Physio, chiro, massage and more done on them and everyone just says stretch and strengthen them. \n\nToday I was about to go for a job and I was warming up my doing single leg RDL\u2019s with a 25lbs kettlebell. I did some other stretches and then proceeded to do a standing tree pose where I placed my right foot over my left knee whilst standing and then going into a squat to get a stretch in. While doing so I felt my knee pop so loud and the sensation of it was so intense. \n\nI immediately sat down thinking I hurt my knee but to my surprise my knee was fine but my hamstring tightness on my right leg was gone. I have no idea how this is correlated and I was hoping to gain some insight. I\u2019ve never had knee tightness or any issues with my knee so I\u2019m surprised that popping or ?realignment? resulted in instant tightness relief. \n\nI tried doing the same process on my left leg which is also tight but nothing happened. \n\nSo does anyone know how the knee popping is correlated to chronic hamstring tightness. I\u2019m surprised no therapist caught it. \n\nAnd does anyone know how to actively release it so I can do my left leg as well? \n\nThanks!",

Never acted on them though.\n\nAnyways, I recently graduated college, I started dating my GF sometime in my Junior year of college, and she was my first for basically everything, I'm however not my GF's first for anything. My friend had to go to college for an extra year. Also I should mention, one would think my friend is an incel, he has a neck beard, poor hygiene, and eats nothing but oreos and cheese and drinks nothing but mountain dew and milk. I on the other hand, go to the gym 6 days a week, am well grommed, proper hygiene, stricter diet, all of it and aside from my GF and a single girl I talked to for a few weeks in highschool, I have never really gotten female attention. My friend on the other hand, claims (and I've unfortunatley seen first hand on a few different occasions) to have slept with at least 15 different women. Really goes to show I guess it really is personality that matters, even though he even says and acts like an incel.\n\nWell, last week, he and his neighbor went bar hoping, his neighbor some how \"rizzed up\" like 4 girls all at the same time. So my friend, his neighbor, and these 4 girls all went back to his neighbors place and fucked all night apparently.\n\nNow, I've never cared that my GF was my one and only. I'm happy in my relationship, I love my GF to death, I'm glad she's my one and only... but idk why after hearing my friends story it made me think about all these random hookups I could have had if I tried harder. How I wanna sleep around... but at the same time I know that's not me, I like sex being in relationship there's less risk, more love and passion... but at the same time it's like damn.\n\nIdk why I'm so jealous, idk why I'm wishing for more, or to atleast do more wild and crazy things with my GF (not bringing in a other person, I'm not a sharer in relationships)... I love my GF but I feel I need more and I hate this primal brain and urge because I want to be with my GF but I also want to do dumb shit. \n\nIt's most likely just the horny talking, cuz I know as soon as I nut I'll be like damn bro, don't care anymore. But still...",

Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.**\n \n* Playing video games such as Baldur's gate 3, Starfield, The Sims 4, Final Fantasy series, as well as some older video games. [The recommended specs needed for BG3 is totally fine](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-system-requirements-pc-performance-and-best-settings-to-use). My issue with the laptop was how easy it was to overheat, and I assumed desktop computers would come with better performance and less overheating risk, but please let me know if I'm wrong.\n \n>**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** \n \n* I believe my laptop was ~$1800, around that range is good. Maximum is probably $2k-$2.5k.\n \n>**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** \n \n* Hopefully between December and spring of 2024. Yes, that's a long time away, but I am a busy person who needs to take the time. I do not mind out of date builds as long as it can play my games at minimum to recommended specs and allows me to create digital art. \n \n>**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc\\)** \n \n* Only tower and monitor (I want a reasonably shaped one. Really don't like those super wide ones, sorry.)\n \n>**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** \n \n* California, USA. There's not really a microcenter that close to me, but I have Best Buy and am willing to purchase from online.\n \n>**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** \n \n* I will probably just reuse a logitech mouse, but if you're willing to let me reconsider I will do that too.\n \n>**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** \n \n* I don't know how to do that, so no.\n \n>**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**\n \n* 1 TB SSD. GPU Any Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 or higher and an AMD Ryzen processor. 1440p monitor at most probably. Please no ultrawide monitors. 16-32 GB RAM and 16 GB VRAM.\n \n>**What type of network connectivity do you need? (Wired and/or WiFi) If WiFi is needed and you would like to find the fastest match for your wireless router, please list any specifics.**\n \n* I have a wireless router, no need.\n \n>**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**\n \n* Doesn't have to be extra flashy or anything, I'm more concerned with the size of the tower, it should fit under my desk with enough legroom. Again, nothing huge and flashy. Just needs to work. \n \n>**Do you need a copy of Windows included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference?**\n \n* I can acquire a Windows 10 copy easily, if it comes with Windows 11 I can just downgrade.\n \n>**Extra info or particulars:**\nBrands I am familiar with and trust are Lenovo and ASUS, but I am open to others.\nI have a sibling who can help me with the money and building the computer itself. I'm generally better with the software side of things. Thank you!",

I was really surprised by how comfy they were considering I wore them fresh out of the store, for the rest of my shopping trip. Which lasted a couple of hours. When I got home I noticed there was a manufacturers defect in the stitching so yesterday I exchanged the boots for some fresh ones. Oiled them up again. Today I\u2019m wearing them, a couple hundred metres later my feet cannot bear the pain of the new boots. I can\u2019t even walk back home. I took my foot out of the boot and they were about to bleed. Just from walking a couple of blocks. They hurt so much I have to get my boyfriend to come pick me up in his car (literally blocks away from the house). Why were my first marts so comfy but these ones are digging into the back of my foot?they are the same model, and same size! Is there anything I can do to make them not rip my feet apart?",

Today the\nMD in the office reviewed the images and said that I definitely have adenomyosis and likely endometriosis. The recommendation was hysterectomy since conservative measures have failed. Due to my medical history, she cannot do the surgery at the hospital associated with the practice and is referring me to a gyn who specializes in robotic assisted hysterectomy at a larger hospital.

RN well is objectively better for what its used for and I dont think theres a fix for that besides nerfing well which I DO NOT want. Well is fine dont nerf. Instead since bubbles buff is less powerful now a really cool exotic for bubble titan could be made that gives it additional viability for group content. \n\nAn exotic armor piece that makes it when you pop bubble the direction you're facing when you pop it has a small section is that 1 sides barrier that the titan exotic arms have. I am a warlock forgive me for not knowing the name. But basically a 1 sided window to shoot through so the trade off of bubble vs well is bubble offers basically perfect defense but less dmg buff. \n\nThe perk could be worded like this maybe: You and Allies can shoot through a section of your Ward of Dawn in the direction you were facing when the ward was cast. \n\nIm not a graphic designer or artist so no picture but you get the point. Probably a chest piece exotic since titans have so many arms.",

The eyesight is not working, RAB disabled, lane assist disabled, the radio doesn\u2019t have volume, and the AC is struggling to pump out air.\n\nI took it to a local mechanic right away and the fault codes were the thermo control valve and alternator. They said I needed to take it to the dealership to fix because they couldn\u2019t do anything to help.\n\nOn my way to the dealership I called Subaru of America and opened a case number because I know this will be a hefty bill. The service department at the dealership said the thermo control valve will be a $2k job itself. \n\nJust curious if anybody has delt with this or something similar or can offer any advice. For giggles I went to the sales team and asked how much they\u2019d offer me and I got in writing $15k (it was in a cosmetic not at fault accident earlier in the year and is on the carfax). Service appointment is set for tomorrow morning and they\u2019ll call with an estimate. If the bill to fix it is close to half the value of the vehicle, I\u2019m half tempted to take them up on that offer. Thoughts?",

This breed's intelligence is commonly evaluated by humans who place an enormous importance on obedience. But we should remember, German Shepherds were bred to work independently for several years. Let's reconceptualize and look beyond mere obedience.\n\nRiley's command of a broad vocabulary sometimes mandates I spell words to communicate without him comprehending straight away. With a bit of training, he responds to my requests \u2013 be it stepping aside when I say 'excuse me' or even fetching things I ask for. However, his compliance is a calculated decision, indicative of his inherent independence and thoughtful reasoning.\n\nRiley's heroics went beyond companionship last summer when he defended me from a potential bear attack at work. Since then, he has displayed acute sensory skills, actively scanning for the presence of bears and ensuring our safety, revealing both his inherent capabilities and adaptive intelligence.\n\nWhile German Shepherds were not initially bred to be in close human contact, they exhibit a remarkable ability to understand and engage. Owners like me have come to understand that the breed's intelligence isn't purely about obedience \u2013 sometimes, they deliberately choose to ignore commands. ",

    "selftext": "Hi there! \n\nKeep getting questions about this, so thought I'd make a dedicated post.\n\nIf you bought the game on DLSite or FANZA, gz on your new game!\n\nNow, a lot of people are having problems installing the game, which kinda sucks when you dropped that much money on a game, and the installer just says that the game is corrupt, right?\n\nSo, here's some instructions to help you out, I am working on a pack for it, so that will soon be an option if all else fails, but this should work.\n\n\n\n1. Download the game |\n\nThe game comes in 3 files, one of which is a exe. You can run that to extract the main installer, make sure that all these 3 files are in the same folder. If they are in the same folder and it still fails, you need to redownload. Sucks, but that happens when downloading from browsers every so often.\n\n\n\n2. Rename folders (SUPER IMPORTANT!!!) |\n\nThe exe will extract some folders, most of which are in Japanese. This is not good. Rename all folders with Japanese letters in them to whatever you wish, doesn't matter as long as it only contains English letters. Failing to do so will cause the installer to claim that the installer is corrupted. This is due to the installer not being able to read Japanese letters on non-japanese windows installs.\n\n\n\n3. Install the game |\n\nWhen browsing the files you will first find a file named startup, ignore this one, as that contains the DRM, and proceed into the setup folder and run the setup.exe, which does not seem to have DRM. Install the game wherever you want, but keep it short, deep folders are known to cause problems.\n\n\n\n4. Make sure you're online and play... maybe use a VPN |\n\nThe game calls home everytime it shows the main menu, and sends some data to ILLGAMES' servers, which theoretically means they can capture your IP. If that's a problem for you, use a VPN. Getting reports that people have problems if the internet goes out. That requirement seems to not be a thing in my upcoming pack, I'll release instructions and a mini pack for people that bought the game to just address this sometime tomorrow alongside the repack.\n\n\n\nHope this helps someone \ud83d\ude0c",

    "selftext": "So this year I bought and played Fallout 4 for the first time. As a fallout fan, I took the advice to not really compare it to New Vegas but rather to Fallout 3 or Skyrim, so I tried to play it not for the plot but for exploration and having fun in the nuclear wasteland. In conclusion I don't understand people who love it and I also don't understand people who hate it. There are some things in this game to have fun with, but at the same time I was still disappointed by it in more than one aspect.  \n\n\nPositives: Shooting is fun and imo well done. I really liked how they handled power armors. I liked graphics, animations and atmosphere. I really liked Piper, Cait and Hancock, they had better, more complex personalities than probably anyone in Skyrim and Fallout 3. I ended up romancing Cait. Goodneighbour is the highlight of this game, I got some 50's suit and a tommy gun and I haven't felt so cool in a video game in a long time. Cait looked great in a white shirt, a vest and a fedora too  \n\n\nI obviously didn't like the plot and the dialogue system but what I want to focus on in this post is how the whole game, both the main plot and side quests, feel like they only have a Single Plot Twist\u2122, that is just \"Synths\" or working for the Institute\n\n>!Hey, look at that guy, he's hiding something. Ah, yes, he's a synth. You meet a beauty on the run with a dark past, I wonder what's her deal. Oh, yeah, she's a synth. I was so excited when I stumbled upon the Covenant, with how creepy it felt. But yeah, their big mistery was working for the Insitute. It added a big deal to my feeling of being disappointed by this game. By the time I learned that Danse is a synth I was like \"Game, how the hell do you still expect me to be surprised by The Single Plot Twist\u2122? The Single Plot Twist\u2122 is everywhere. Yeah, no shit he's a synth, half of the Commonwealth's population are synths or working for the Insitute. My character himself could be a synth with fabricated memories and I wouldn't even be remotely surprised at this point\"!<  \n\n\nThe Single Plot Twist\u2122 made exploration less fun for me. I remember in Fallout 3 and Skyrim we got a lot of different small stories that were going on. Fallout 4 feels like everything just tie back to Synths and Synths are not even a good enought plot point to justify constructing your whole world around it. In Skyrim we had different guilds with totally separate quests, the main dragon quest and a civil war going on. Were they exceptionally good plots with deep stories? No. But it worked better as a whole because of diversity.   \n\n\nEven factions in Fallout 4 don't have any political programs about ruling the Commonwealth, they only differ by their stance on Synths. Minutemen are an exception but they don't really have any views at all, their only program is rebuilding settlements, they are hardly even a faction at all to be honest.\n\nAh, yes, settlements. I picked up Fallout 4 in the first place because I got excited about the idea of scavenging the wasteland and building settlements. I took my time rebuilding Sanctuary because it felt like something the main character would like to do. Just rebuild his home for himself and his friends. But gathering resources, especially rare ones, turned out to be rather tedious and I was overwhelmed by the amount of settlements to rebuild. Dealing with janky building mechanics left me, again, a bit disappointed in the end.\n\nSo, all in all, I sided with the Railroad, finished the main quest and I feel so done with this game. I put 102 hours into it tho so it's not like I didn't have fun. I did. But I don't see myself coming back ever like I come back to Skyrim and older Fallouts every few years.\n\nI am somewhat excited for Fallout London tho, because I see it keeping the really good things like gunplay and aesthetics while replacing mediocre setting, plot and quests",

In the past, I have read \u201cThe Singularity Is Near\u201d by Ray Kurzweil and looked into the concept of the technological singularity for quite a while. I have also read several papers on the topic from various sources and perspectives. I got very fascinated by it and I believe that we might achieve many currently unthinkable things if it really happened. I would do much in my power to accelerate its occurrence (such as conducting research). I know this is a controversial and risky stance, but I am willing to take the chance.\n\nI am looking for some guidance on how to pursue this path as a career. I wonder which field is most likely to cause the singularity, whether it is artificial intelligence, neuroscience, biotechnology, nanotechnology, quantum computing or something else. I would also like to know which university degree is the most useful and beneficial for my goals, whether I should focus on one field or try to learn multiple disciplines and how I can do research on my own.\n\nPlease note that the singularity will not necessarily happen and we do not even know how likely it is to happen. So I do not intend to devote my entire life to it. I want to know what skills and knowledge I should acquire and how I can network with other like-minded people and organizations.\n\nI would appreciate any advice or insight from anyone who shares my passion or has experience in research and development.

    "selftext": "TL;DR last paragraph.\n\nHi, I was diagnosed with Hashimotos maybe 8 years ago. My TSH across various blood tests over the years varied from 8.4 to 4.4. Mostly in the 5-6.5 range. Antibodies were tested and confirmed in later tests. T3 levels were in the low normal range (at least when last tested ~2 years ago).\n\nSo here's the thing. I'm extremely active and very physically fit, but for the past 5-6 years, a number of issues have cropped up, and they all seem to be soft issue/overuse related. None are \"injuries\" per SE.\n\nBasically I have developed tendonitis (the proper term is tendonosis actually) in many places. Tennis elbow (recent, resistant to physio). Golfers elbow for 4+ years. Mild. Triceps tendonosis for about 6 years. Mild but resistant to physio. Last 1.5 years I developed rotator cuff tendonosis in both shoulders (different tendons but both rotators) - resistant to physio, small improvements but plateauing hard. Only my biceps tendon issues \"healed\", maybe I caught it early. Extensors tendons in forearms aren't bad but do tend to get overworked, mild tendonopathy maybe.\n\nOn top of all this, I developed plantar fasciitis in both feet about 6 years ago. It's constant, resistant to treatment (calf stretches, flat shoes etc).\n\nHere's the thing. I am able to \"manage\" the pain. They're mostly mild or moderate, but it's like my body is trying to repair itself but can't keep up with the usage (I'm not overtraining, I rested my rotators for months and still no improvement).\n\nAlso I developed mild TMJ the last 2 years too spontaneously! No improvements despite attempts with self physio. I don't grind my teeth.\n\nOther members of my family are just as active and suffer none of these issues. This started to bother me a lot recently as I pondered the amount of these issues that had piled up. I'm young and fit and there seems to be a pattern here... soft tissue injuries, particularly  in areas with limited blood flow (tendons) which take time to heal. I read some studies about the link between plantar fasciitis and also there are studies about the potential link between hashimotos and tendonopathies.\n\nSo I decided to bring this up to my doctor. He didn't seem to buy that it was related to my thyroid (due to T3 being basically OK in all tests). He recommended a blood test with thyroid panel, but also recommended ANA (might be Lupus or mixed connective tissue disease according to him - I personally doubt it because I lack the other symptoms). I'm personally convinced of my theory, but it may simply be hoping because I want to believe that getting treated will help my tendon issues.\n\n\nTL;DR\n\nRange of tendon issues and plantar fasciitis cropping up the last 5-6 years. All resistant to physio. All of them. I suspect subclinical hypothyroidism. I am going to push for it even if doctor is reluctant to treat. Am I onto something? Anyone else have similar issues? Maybe others have had plantar fasciitis go away once they got their hormone treatment?\n\nThanks for reading!",

So I know it isn\u2019t impossible to get an offer in this economy.  \n\nSome more background that is giving me some cushion, I live with my parents and the only expenses I currently have is my $585 car note. I was hoping to move out but I want another role first now. Would love to hear y\u2019all thoughts and please let me know if this is a good, bad or dumb idea? I need some unbiased feedback.

    "selftext": "I (f23) moved into a new place with 2 friends of mine. The one girl who we will call (f23) \u201cJessica\u201d I\u2019ve lived with in the past, we live well together and generally have 0 problems and I actually really enjoy being rough mates with them. My other roommate who we will call \u201cTatum\u201d (f24) is an old co worker of mine. Right around the time I was thinking about moving into the place Tatum breaks up with their girlfriend and asks to move into the house around the same time as me since we needed another roommate anyways. We said yes. For context, Tatum has 2 cats, I have 1, Jessica doesn\u2019t have any pets. \n\nIt\u2019s been about 3 months of us all living together and since the beginning me and Jessica have noticed Tatum does not take the best care of their cats. Litter boxes will go DAYS or even weeks without being scooped, so the whole main floor reeks like cat piss and litter. Tatum also just scoops the litter into an open cardboard box and let\u2019s weeks of scooped litter pile up.  One of Tatums cats has peed on mine and jessica\u2019s shoes and furniture multiple times. We brought this to Tatums attention, they apologized, offered to buy us new shoes (which never happened) and said they are trying to fix the problem. We have asked nicely multiple times to do something about the smell of the litter and pee that has seeped into the carpets, but time and time again Tatum does not do anything and the problem continues. This has escalated so far that the whole house smells so bad; I\u2019m embarrassed to have people over and me and Jessica don\u2019t wanna spend time anywhere else but our rooms. \n\nWe brought it up AGAIN recently, and Tatum flipped out and sent us a really passive aggressive text, telling us to not assume they have all the time in the world to clean because they work full time. WE ALL WORK FULLTIME AND ME AND JESSICA HAVE 0 ISSUES KEEPING COMMUNAL AREAS CLEAN. I even keep my cat + her litter box in my room so my roommates don\u2019t have to deal with it. I truly cannot emphasize how bad our house smells, on top of this all, Tatum has not vacuumed the carpet ONCE since they moved in and it gets covered in cat hair, which leaves me and jessica to vacuum every week. I want to stop doing Tatums chores for them, but if I don\u2019t the house would be absolutely disgusting. This includes taking out their garbage, and putting their dishes away. \n\nWe have offered Tatum our help, we\u2019ve offered suggestions, like getting a closed lid garbage can for the scooped litter, keeping their cats in their room etc. \n\nIs this enough of reasoning to ask them to move out when our lease is up in october?\n\n Jessica and I will have no problems finding a new roommate so i\u2019m not worried about that. But time and time again mine and jessica\u2019s stuff is getting covered in cat pee and we can\u2019t even enjoy the house that is supposed to be collectively ours. I don\u2019t even consider Tatum a friend of mine anymore because everyday they continue to disrespect me and Jessica. \n\nPlease give me some advice :(",

    "selftext": "\n\nA guy was at home and saw someone he recognized, break his gate and steal his motorcycle.  He went to the police and opened a report, stating: \"I saw Juan, a tall, dark, muscular guy with an earring, bust the gate and steal my bike.\"\n\nThe police altered the report, not including any details describing the theif: \"The victim of the robbery woke up and noticed that his motorcycle was gone.\" \n\nIn the raid request, the police wrote that they investigated in the victim's neighborhood and found someone named Esteban. He says he was sweeping his sidewalk, and I walked by and introduced myself. \"Hi, I'm Nico, they call me the Yankee, I live at the 2800 block of x street...\" we spoke for a few minutes and I kept walking. A few minutes later, he says he saw me pass by on a motorcycle similar to the one that was stolen.\n\nWith that information, the police went to my neighborhood and asked around. One person, Bernardo, told them that I approached him while on a motorcycle similar to the one stolen, license plates covered with tape. Again, I introduce myself and offer to sell it for \"very cheap\". He said he didnt want it, and I insisted... \"if you change your mind, I live in that house there on the corner\" \n\nWith that investigation completed, the police asked for the raid and the judge approved. \n\nDuring the raid, they found 23g of marijuana (under the legal limit for personal use) as well as a firearm. I have licenses/permits for both.\n\nThe police didn't care and arrested me anyways.\n\n***\nSince my arrest, I've hired several lawyers and a private investigator.\n\nBesides discovering the altered police report filed by the victim, we have confirmed that the two witnesses, Bernardo and Esteban, DO NOT EXIST.\n\nThe detective checked records from Health department, Educational system, labor department, credit reports, the COVID vaccination registry, national voter registry, social media, phone registries...  all searches come up negative.\n\nSo, we went to a hearing... stating all of this.  First, they said we need to go to the robbery court. We went. They sent us back to the narcotics court.\n\nAfterwards the prosecution office started to investigate. They couldn't find those two witnesses anywhere in this province. They continued investigating, and couls not find the 2 witnesses in the entire country. The prosecution asked the police to find them. The police said they couldn't locate them.\n\nA dif prosecution office, the Complex Crimes division then charged the police offciers for \"abuse of power\" and \"failure to perform public duties.\"\n\nWe asked for a declaration of prejudiciality (that a decision on the legality of the raid should be completed before my case is decided). \nThe judge said no. \n\nWe started requesting house arrest...\n\nThe prosecution says theres rumors that I assaulted my partner Heather. She went to testify that, in 18 years of being together, I have never been violent. The prosecution didn't let her speak, stating it could be a declaration made out of fear of reprisals, coercion.\n\nThe prosecution also says I threatened a different witness. She also went to testify that it's not true. Again, they didn't let her speak, saying I probably threatened her to make her say I never threatened her.\n\nLater, we asked to join the case against the police, as plaintiffs. The prosecution (complex crimes office) said no, \"Police's misconduct only harms the state and the people's trust in the state. Not me\". We went to a hearing to discuss the denial of the request. The judge rejected it, saying the investigation of the police had just begun, theres no reason to believe the prosecution wont take it seriously. For them its just begun, we already have months of investigations, evidence, and even had the victim of the bike robbery go declare that his original police report was modified! \n\nMeanwhile, a trial against me is approaching... and the concern is that if the prosecution doesn't go after the police aggressively, or if the police somehow win or get off, I'll lose my defense completely and be convicted.\n\nThey're asking for 8 years jail time.\n\n\nWorse yet, the police raided and arrested 4 more people for the same reason, the stolen motorcycle. They had large quantities of drugs, 10...20 kilos. Those were federal cases because of the large amounts. ALL of them had their charges dropped due to the police's falsehoods. My case is provincial, so im still detained for having a gun and drugs, even though I had the proper permits.\n\nThe owner of the motorcycle still doesn't have the bike and Juan, who stole is bike, is still free, without being raided.\n\nI can prove I didn't steal the motorcycle. Apart from the fact they didn't find it in my house, I was with people during the time of robbery. I have my gps locations, computer internet history, chat logs, and much more, to prove I had nothing to do with the theft.\n\nThe police log book shows they never investigated me. The cops who say they took the police car and walked around and questioned the neighbors... but according to the book, the cops weren't even together. The patrol car was at the courthouse that morning, another officer used it to transport a detainee. I also have the GPS records of the officers showing they never went to the victim's neighborhood or mine. They simply didn't investigate anything. \n\nThe judge ordered the log book be presented within 3 days. The cops havent turned it over... the deadline passed. The judge then declared them \"disobedience of a court order\".\n\nTo complete this tragedy... shortly after all this started...  a Friday night while I was detained, Heather had intense pains... she went to the hospital. They tell her she's pregnant... two days later, she lost the baby.\n\nI miss my family. We need help.\n\nIve made 2 petitions, one in Spanish and one in english.. feel free to sign one or the other...or both. Please. \n\nPETITION ENGLISH\n https://chng.it/kBR7wGG5Zt\n\nPETITION SPANISH \n https://chng.it/PDWDbzRH5k",

    "selftext": "There was a mom and her two boys, one was maybe 4 years old and the other was 5 or 6. The 4yo looked to be buying some cards and it seemed the older boy was upset he couldn\u2019t get the same amount of cards. He was squirmy by the card section, and I guess his mom reached over to grab him to get him to stay out of the way (I was passing through) and he said something like, \u201cyou hurt me.\u201d He was crying at the point but he still said it relatively calmly. His mom responded saying his brother was getting them because he was buying them himself. Anyway, I head to my little area to get orders ready for pickup, and I join two of my coworkers, C and R. Suddenly we hear this kid start having a full on tantrum/meltdown by the card section, which is not something we\u2019re normally able to hear if it\u2019s a normal volume. C begins talking about how this is the reason he\u2019ll never have kids. As we\u2019re listening (and unapologetically standing in the entryway to take a few glances lmao we couldn\u2019t help ourselves) the mom gets her boys to the doors, but the older one is still having a meltdown. He refuses to leave the store since he wants his item. He starts yelling that she\u2019s hurting him or is trying to hurt him (he was like ten feet away from her), and begins having a full-blown panic attack in the middle of the store. Me, C, and R are all exchanging concerned looks. Eventually our (store director I think? I feel like I should know but we have a new one and get new employees frequently so I never really know. Anyway, our store director) comes over to see what was the matter, and the kid, again, still a ways away from his mom, points to her and shouts to our SD, \u201cshe\u2019s trying to break my arm!!\u201d I turned around with my jaw dropped and hand cover my mouth and C had a very similar expression. Ig R didn\u2019t hear what the kid said because he asked what happened so C told him, and R was just like \u201choly shit.\u201d Our SD managed to calm the kid down and the mom was able to leave with her two sons. \n\nObviously, not a normal reaction from a child. I felt so awful, we all did, during that ordeal. We agreed he needed some kind of help, but what tf were we supposed to do? It was such an awful situation to witness and be helpless towards.",

The gate in the faucet still completely shuts off the flow through the tub faucet yet when you pull the toggle up to shut the flow through the faucet off the water pressure in the shower head is basically a trickle, literally. It's a pressure balancing diverter valve from what I can tell and the pressure from the faucet is good as ever it's just the shower head that suffers. It's a pretty old valve so I guess my question is is this a case of replacing the cartridge inside the diverter valve or should I go through the wall on the other side and replace the entire diverter valve for a new one.....

We thought this was weird because the friend that she blocked has been her close friend since freshman year.\n\nWe started to wonder if we could find out who this dude is just for fun and funnily enough he was viewing the instagram story of the dude he made our friend block(sorry if this is confusing). When we got his name i made a search and found his twitter. His twitter likes were full of andrew rate, elon musk and naked women. Which came as a surprise to us because \u201cknowing\u201d our friend she would never date a guy like this. With further research we found out his mom is an avid trump supporter and with even more searches we found his tik tok which is full of worrying stuff like \u201ci would never let my girlfriend tell our close friends anything about us\u201d and \u201ci always know her location\u201d.  Also this might be subjective but we think it\u2019s a little weird that he\u2019s a sophomore in college going to date a senior in highschool. \n\nWe already decided we\u2019re going to ask her about it and stage a little intervention if you will  but we do not really know how to go about it or how she will react. We just want to make sure she doesn\u2019t end up in a long term emotionally abusive relationship with this guy and I think we would be bad friends if we didn\u2019t atleast try to help. \n\nhow should we go about talking to her and telling her all of this????",

Los d\u00f3lares prometidos todav\u00eda, por motivos misteriosos (el d\u00f3lar act\u00faa de maneras misteriosas para algunos, aunque para otros no tanto) no han llegado, de forma que la dolarizaci\u00f3n prometida no ha podido realizarse. De todas maneras, si bien muchos abandonaron su fe libertaria, varios de los fieles de la Iglesia Universal Privada del Reino Libertario-Pro no pierden la esperanza y conf\u00edan en que la Segunda Venida del D\u00f3lar, tal cual est\u00e1 en las sagradas escrituras libertarias, ocurrir\u00e1.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n Verde esperanza, verde d\u00f3lar. Y por la salvaci\u00f3n verde, lo han dado todo.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n Algunos han entregado su aguinaldo al todopoderoso; otros consagraron parte de su salario al templo; otros trabajan horas extras sin mayor paga por la iglesia; otros han inmolado sus vacaciones para confortar a los Ap\u00f3stoles Mercados; y muchos han hecho todos esos sacrificios juntos. Pero esto no es todo, porque los fieles no solo se han martirizado a s\u00ed mismos, sino que tambi\u00e9n han flagelado los ingresos y las condiciones de trabajo de ateos que jam\u00e1s hubieran querido ni siquiera acercarse a la Iglesia Universal Privada del Reino Libertario-PRO.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs\u00ed es la fe.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nY entre los extasiados feligreses est\u00e1 Lautaro, un joven que no ha sacrificado nada a la iglesia, porque b\u00e1sicamente no tiene nada para sacrificar. Trabaja en negro, a destajo, haciendo entregas: gana dos mangos, labura muchas horas y si falta no cobra un centavo. Lo \u00fanico que tiene, lo \u00fanico que adora, es un peque\u00f1o perro atorrante gris y blanco de cinco kilos al que mantiene limpio y alimentado. Es casi en lo \u00fanico en que gasta dinero, y es para lo \u00fanico que tiene dinero para gastar.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPero un d\u00eda, un CEO Sacerdote de menor rango, notando el amor de Lautaro por el animalito, se le acerca. \u201cHe notado que no has dado nada para la vuelta de nuestro Se\u00f1or D\u00f3lar\u201d, lo amonesta con severidad. \u201cEs que no tengo nada. Aunque todav\u00eda tengo fe de tenerlo todo. Si sigo haciendo entregas catorce horas al d\u00eda, en veintid\u00f3s a\u00f1os voy a poder poner mi propio emprendimiento\u201d. \u201cEso es bueno, pero Nuestro Se\u00f1or D\u00f3lar requiere de sacrificios. Todos tus compa\u00f1eros han hecho importantes aportes para que \u00e9l vuelva y no tolerar\u00e1 que t\u00fa no est\u00e9s a su nivel competitivo. Ese ego\u00edsmo tuyo para con tus compa\u00f1eros genera condiciones espirituales poco favorables para que Nuestro Se\u00f1or D\u00f3lar decida volver a invertir en nuestra salvaci\u00f3n\u201d. \u201c\u00bfPero qu\u00e9 podr\u00eda darle?\u201d \u201cEl perro, por supuesto\u201d \u201c\u00bfPero para qu\u00e9 podr\u00eda servirle el perro?\u201d \u201c\u00c9l sabr\u00e1\u201d.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLuego de esta inc\u00f3moda charla, Lautaro se retira a su casa sin prometerle nada al l\u00edder econ\u00f3mico-espiritual. Preocupado, trata de encontrar una soluci\u00f3n para no perder su mascota y no enfurecer a los due\u00f1os de su fe. \u201cPor ah\u00ed podr\u00eda darles un poco de plata: si estiro lo de poner mi propio emprendimiento tres a\u00f1os m\u00e1s, les puedo dar un siete por ciento de lo que gano. A lo mejor esa guita le sirve al Dios D\u00f3lar.  En lugar de veintid\u00f3s, ser\u00edan veinticinco a\u00f1os para ponerlo, pero bueno, no puedo hacerlo enojar, es nuestro Se\u00f1or D\u00f3lar.\u201d, piensa.  Luego de esta reflexi\u00f3n, contento por tener un ofrecimiento que le permitir\u00eda saciar al CEO-Sacerdote sin entregar a su amado perrito, se va a dormir.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPero al otro d\u00eda, al despertar, por completo aterrado, nota que el simp\u00e1tico animalito no est\u00e1. Va corriendo al Templo y encuentra que el CEO-Sacerdote lo tiene en sus aposentos. \u201cMuchas gracias por tu desinteresado aporte. Sabemos que es un sacrificio duro para ti, porque este bichito te daba mucha alegr\u00eda, pero te puedo asegurar que este esfuerzo que nos hemos visto forzados a forzarte a hacer dar\u00e1 en pocos a\u00f1os sus frutos, y que podr\u00e1s disfrutar de hermosos p\n\nerros pitbull comprados con tu flamante salario en d\u00f3lares\u201d, le dice con una sonrisa falsa.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPero Lautaro no quiere perros pitbull: quiere al gris y blanco de cinco kilos. Como no puede ni so\u00f1ar con atreverse a desafiar al CEO-Sacerdote, en lugar de meterle una pi\u00f1a, que es lo que quiere hacer, se limita a retirarse de La Iglesia Universal Privada del Reino Libertario-PRO con l\u00e1grimas en sus ojos. Nunca m\u00e1s volver\u00e1 al templo, pero el da\u00f1o ya est\u00e1 hecho: el perro no lo va a recuperar nunca. Peor a\u00fan, en un futuro intentar\u00e1 conseguir otro animalito, y el culto al que ya no pertenece se lo impedir\u00e1.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u00bfD\u00f3lares? La vuelta de Cristo es mucho m\u00e1s probable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEp\u00edlogo: \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 el CEO-Sacerdote quiso al perro de Lautaro? Hay varias hip\u00f3tesis: por un lado tiene una relaci\u00f3n de amor un tanto exagerada (a nivel incluso f\u00edsico) con esos animales. Por otro, la Iglesia Universal  Privada del Reino Libertario-PRO necesita chupar absolutamente todos los recursos que pueda, as\u00ed estos sean tan rid\u00edculos como un perro de cinco kilos. Por \u00faltimo,  el culto libertario no puede dejar en paz a un pobre asalariado, tiene siempre que obligarlo a renunciar a algo valioso, sobre todo si este no tiene nada para dar.\n\n&#x200B;\n\noriginalmente en [\u00a1Lo qu\u00e9?](https://pellenarra.blogspot.com/2023/08/el-dolar-nos-llevara-al-reino-de-los.html)",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nso I am currently in grad school and this quarter began the beginning of July. I also just started my traineeship and things have been moving pretty fast. Just for some context I am 25 and this year I have also made it a mission to not date because of my history with relationships and recognizing that I do need to do some hard work in order to be an effective clinician. July 20th I met with my first client and we got a lot done for literally only being able to have 4 session before going out of state for school. One of the things my client was dealing with was disordered eating which I could relate too due to being in Eating disorder treatment in my past. I had clinical practicum today and someone asked me whether I self disclosed with my client and I stated that I mentioned it in like a brief way around the 3rd session and it was along the lines of \"this is nothing to be ashamed of a lot of people struggle with this, I have myself and sometimes still do but its important to be compassionate...\" I can't remember my exact wording though. We went on to discuss when it appropriate to self disclose and I mentioned that I felt like I was doing it for the benefit of my client so she wouldn't feel alone and my professor gentle and kindly mentioned that she felt I could have done that without self disclosure since there is a large population of people with disorder eating and I possibly could have altered our therapeutic alliance too much. I was thinking about it a lot and I know that I was experiencing a lot of anxiety during sessions (which I normally feel when having Zoom meetings and when I get the chance to say it to people; everyone is like \"omg i can't even tell\") and one thing with my anxiety is it literally feels like when spongebob is searching for his name and everything is on fire in his brain, and I have a hard time stopping myself from saying things (I experience this in my friends too). There were other times where I was able to catch myself before saying anything so part of me is thinking that I may have self disclosed in the hope of alleviating my anxiety but not really noticing because of the anxiety.\n\nI met with my therapist Monday and mentioned that I have been feeling extremely overwhelmed and in adequate and that I have been trying hard to remind myself of what she told me when I first started, that I am not going to be good at it on my first try, just as I wasn't good at walking or writing when I first learned, but it hasn't been helping. She mentioned that on top of dealing with phase of life stuff, my toxic perfectionism (not her words but I heard this term and I liked it) is heightened because of everything. So i am going to start things to work on this like journaling about the 3 things that make me awesome nightly (homework from therapist), trying to do fun exercise in the morning to release the physical tremors I get when on zoom calls, meditating before zoom session or even class so Im more present, and a couple other things. \n\nI guess I am just curious if anyone else has experienced this extreme insecurity when starting in the field. I'm trying really hard to keep myself from spiraling and maybe this is all in combination with the quarter ending next week and trying to get homework done.",

There are a few sort of theories that could add upon it.\n\nFirst of all, it should be noted that X had already been through alot in the previous 6 games.\n\n[Some of his friends \\(And Sigma\\) became mavericks.](https://preview.redd.it/dhfmxop48jlb1.png?width=670&format=png&auto=webp&s=8bc4f983ddbae078bfefd08442299ad6e022bf68)\n\n[Fought Sigma 6 times.](https://preview.redd.it/8cg8kxpa8jlb1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=75ea84089304c52aea9401e590f58c76523f6ea3)\n\n[Zero died in his hands twice.](https://preview.redd.it/63p6mmkd8jlb1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=d604188918167dfbb0a1828e0c44b5dc250e31f7)\n\nSo in that case, by X7, it's safe to say X would likely have PTSD. You didn't think a reploid would have PTSD? Well that's the case here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd now the second theory relates to the Ultimate Armor. Now, there is a video by ColeFam discussing about the Ultimate Armor having a different appearance in each game.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j7glcsudajlb1.png?width=1074&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d6f905ce55a6f0806401cecba16e4f4bd0c8ad1\n\nTo summarize it, as X is using it more, the power of the Ultimate Armor sort of degrades. And eventually became unusable by the end of X6. Although I do want to add an extra step to that. That being, since the Ultimate Armor is essentially pushing X's potential to the absolute maximum, it would also end up weakening X. And so by the end of X6, the Ultimate Armor would've likely been destroyed (Probably from fighting Sigma the 6th time) and it ended up weakening X severely. And he essentially needed to recover.\n\n[However, this also means that by X7, X would've essentially recovered just enough to eventually fight again \\(Despite not doing so early on in the game\\). Although he wouldn't be at full strength by then.](https://preview.redd.it/taza682fbjlb1.png?width=1282&format=png&auto=webp&s=d21c812ae24f631cdf5a8be9a0bd05acc8dc7563)\n\nAnd now with those 2 theories (One I expanded on), you can understand about X not being available in X7 initially.",

Not only has she dropped her nap but unless we rock her while she is asleep for 45+ minutes and verrrry carefully move her to her crib without waking her she will scream bloody murder non-stop until I finally can't take it anymore and start the whole rocking process all over again. During all of this we have tried moving sleep times around, moving dinner closer to bed, etc. She has a consistent bedtime routine and has since she was very little. \n\nSo my question is: how long can a kiddo this age safely CIO?

She meant well and did her best, but we had a language barrier. I don't think Amy is fluent in English.\n\nWithout going into too much detail, we had multiple miscommunications, but we resolved them. At the end of the visit, my discharge was delayed by at least half an hour because of a misunderstanding about paperwork.\n\nThe paperwork issue happened in front of other staff, including \"Becky\" (not her real name). I did not say anything rude or snarky, because nothing good comes out of that, but I think people could sense that I was frustrated that I had just spent half an hour needlessly waiting over a miscommunication.\n\nIt's a large campus. When I was walking to the parking lot, Becky came running to me. Maybe she'd just left for her lunch break.\n\nBecky said they've been having a lot of communications problems with Amy and asked me to file a complaint with admin about it.\n\nAt first, I thought there's no way in hell I'd do that, but Becky went onto say that they might send Amy to a different department. She explained that urgent care is like emergency-lite, and it's supposed to be fast-paced but the communication issues with Amy are causing unnecessary delays.\n\nIn theory, that makes sense. They can save time in the urgent care if Amy goes to a different department for now, and maybe Amy can come back after she has more practice communicating in English. I have no idea how this works in practice though.\n\nSo after reading that, I want to hear from you\n\n**1) Do you think this issue is a big deal?**\n\n**2) Do you think there's a high likelihood of something good coming out of it?**",

Also, everything in this city is freakishly expensive. I haven\u2019t gone to a restaurant or deli counter and seen an entree for under $10 the entire time I\u2019ve been here, and a week\u2019s worth of groceries for one will regularly run me close to $150. I went vegetarian for awhile because meat was just prohibitively expensive.\n\nThe one good thing this city has, for me, is it\u2019s stellar medical care, specifically in regards to hormone replacement therapy and gender transition resources. It\u2019s also, y\u2019know, bleeding-heart-liberal Massachusetts, so I\u2019ve never felt unsafe or endangered as a trans person here and there are plenty of people like me.\n\nMy five-year plan is to GTFO. I\u2019m going back to school for an audio engineering degree and would prefer to work/live in a city with good offerings for musicians, but don\u2019t expect to have a full-time studio or venue job right out of college. I prefer colder climates, but being from Texas I\u2019m not unaccustomed to 110+ degree summers either. \n\nIn short, I need a city that has:\n- *reliable* public transit (sorry MBTA)\n- resources for trans & queer people\n- a solid local arts & music scene\n- safe-for-habitation apartments around $1k/mo\n\nFriends and family have recommended me Chicago & Philadelphia, and I\u2019m leaning towards Chicago since my parents may move to Champaign-Urbana around the same time as me. However, I\u2019d be happy to explore my options, and would appreciate help in doing so. Thanks!",

    "selftext": "There\u2019s so much talk about what\u2019s the best sports anime. I personally think Haikyuu is the best sports anime, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s close. (Kuroko\u2019s Basketball is better than blue lock.) I have my reasons below:\n\nDon't get me wrong, Blue Lock is amazing. Very different from other sports animes as it has a unique plot with diverse characters and abilities.\nThe idea of being an \"egotist\" is really interesting. But even though Haikyuu is more simple, it is still a masterpiece. Plot, pacing, characters...all amazing. There are no bad characters. Ofcourse, it all depends on your taste, but I don't think Blue Lock has the same bond and comedy with its characters. Haikyuu is one of the best comfort animes which is part of the reason of why it's so popular. The characters may not have special abilities, but the matches are still very intense and enjoyable. The way that it's written is as if everyone is the main character and that's what I like about it. \n\nEach character is different in their own way and they don't have to be all dark and gloomy to show that they're the best on the court. It's what makes them so lovable. I noticed that most people prefer Blue Lock over Haikyuu because it doesn't make the sport seem \"basic\". Blue Lock's abilities are diverse, but I feel like all the characters have the same personalities. Almost all of them are cold and arrogant and there's not much different from them. I absolutely love \u201cvillainous\u201d characters that almost never lose but each character kind of feels the same. For example, Itoshi Rin: cold and arrogant. Because he's so good, he has almost no personality. Another character is Barou Shouei. His ego is so high that he won't even pass the ball. And I guess this makes sense because Furudate played volleyball while the creator of Blue Loco didn\u2019t play soccer.\n\nI don\u2019t really find blue lock characters enjoyable. Sure, they\u2019re really good at soccer which makes them intriguing to watch but there\u2019s no feeling. Barou is a great player but wouldn't get as far in the real world...which brings me to my next point: There's no representation of team work. I don't like the fact that the players are taught to have a big ego. Of course individual skill matters but team work is also very important if you want to win, especially in a sport like soccer. As I said before Blue Lock doesn't have that same bond with the characters like Haikyuu does. The bond between teammates is very important because if you can't trust each other off the field then you definitely won't trust each other on the field. \n\nAnd a great example would be Isagi, Barou, and Nagi vs Kunigami, Reo, and Chigiri. The reason they lost chances to score was because they had no teamwork. Barou was too arrogant and wouldn't pass the ball so he just ended up losing it. Isagi saw this aswell even though they ended up winning. My point is that you don't have to think you're better than everyone to win or for the anime to be enjoyable. Oikawa from Haikyuu is a great representation of a big ego. His ego may not be as big as blue lock characters but the way he\u2019s written still shows that you can be an egotist and still value team spirit. \n\nHaikyuu's representation of the sport is so much better. They're able to represent teamwork AND rivalries at the same time. As someone who plays soccer, Blue Lock was a bit of a letdown. Blue Lock is mostly only centered around the few characters and 1 position while Haikyuu focuses on all positions and all characters, even if they aren\u2019t on the main team. They could be the worst player in the show and still get the spotlight. The focus on each character's growth and personal journey is what makes Haikyuu!! unique. Furudate makes the worst players seem like the best players. The story becomes infinitely more complex as a result. It demonstrates how they are tested but ultimately learn from the experience. They become better players on the court as a result, which also makes them more entertaining to watch for fans.  The show seems to have more meaning than just being another sports anime. \n\nI love how the rival characters from other schools aren't portrayed as villains. They love volleyball just as much as our main cast. And I think another reason why so many people love Haikyuu is because it inspires people to play the sport, and this also ties into good representation. But what do you guys think?",

Don't get me wrong, it looks sick, but I got myself wanting for a game where I could take my time and really explore the atmosphere and lore of this amazing universe.\n\nI do have to say that I am not *that* familiar with the source material. Last year I got kinda hyperfocused on W40K for a couple of months, and ended up watching hours of lore videos and read the first 3 Horus Heresy books (which I loved... until I didn't. >!It felt so cheap to have Horus be deceived instead of turning to the dark side because he felt betrayed by the Emperor -- his motives were right there!!!! And then he just turns cartoonishly evil super fast lmao!<)\n\nAnyway I'm getting sidetracked. What I mean is: I would kill for a story-focused W40k game. Ok, maybe Telltale wouldn't be the best fit aesthetics wise, but it could work. Hell, even a Visual Novel would be awesome! I want to explore this universe not just in its glorious fights, but in its deep lore as well.\n\nSo that's my rant. What do you think? Would a game like this work, in your opinion? Or are you ok with just bashing heads and leading glory to the Emperor?\n\ntl;dr: I really want a story-heavy W40K game so I can immerse myself in its universe.  \n\n\n(edit: typos)",

It still just confuses and annoys me. \n\nHis pov is he would be even more stressed out worrying about my safety and feeling like im cheating. He also feels its more misogynistic that men are throwing money at me for their own fantasies and ideas. \n\nMe i dont feel same way, ive put dudes in credit card debt and had luxuries purchased for me while their own families waited for essentials, thats not very misogynistic if you ask me.\n\nNow ive long since accepted that being a stripper would not work realistically for any real relationship especially the type of man i want which does require me to live up to some misogynistic concepts.

    "selftext": "My boyfriend and i have been together for almost 5 years, we\u2019ve always talked about a family, marriage, children, everything. I\u2019ve dreamed about it for years. I\u2019m not on birth control, we typically use the pullout method, and sometimes plan b if needed. About a month and a half ago I found out he has been cheating on me- nothing physical, only over messages (although that doesn\u2019t make it any less bad for me) we broke up, I kicked him out, and a few weeks later ultimately decided to give him another chance with couples counseling, transparency in other areas etc. I truly believe he\u2019s learned he made the biggest mistake of his life and won\u2019t do something so stupid again. We had sex like a week or two after he came back only 1-3 times in a week. It felt right at the time and we haven\u2019t since. He pulled out as usual, and We\u2019ve been much less safe with no issues. but of course\u2026 I\u2019m pregnant. \n\nRight now both of our mental states are incredibly low after everything. My mental health has never been this low in my life. I just can\u2019t seem to catch a break. We are planning for a medical abortion mainly because of the mental state we are in right now and the fragility of our relationship already trying to stay above water. \n\nBut wow. I never expected the emotions to feel like this but i guess when it\u2019s something you\u2019ve dreamed of with this person, it\u2019s really hard to get rid of when it\u2019s half you and half them. Idk the point of this post really, I guess just grieving something I\u2019ve dreamed of and feeling so guilty for it. \n\nAlso I have terrible medical anxiety so any advice on what to expect going to a planned parenthood for a pill abortion would be greatly appreciated\ud83e\udd0d",

One of the main differences between my undergrad institution and the current school is that my undergrad institution was huge, (top 3 in the country in terms of total students), and so I had a wide variety of friends also, I was in a city, so there was lots of stuff to do. Now, I\u2019ve graduated and gone to do my Masters as a school which is so small, to the point where the campus population is nearly half, and is entirely run by Greek life. There\u2019s pretty much nothing else but bars. My cohort is pretty dominated by international students, and I\u2019m one of the 30% of the domestic kids.  Right away I feel like I just don\u2019t belong here, and I can\u2019t really meet anyone. My apartment complex has mostly undergrads, and they are all seniors at the university (probably 1 year younger).  I went to introduce myself one day and they were making conversation but made it painfully obvious that they don\u2019t want to talk to me and would rather be by themselves amongst their group. I ended up just going back to my apartment and spending the evening calling old friends from school because I have nothing else to do outside of studying. \n\nWas anyone else in this situation before?",

    "selftext": "Background: I 33F have been a full time parental figure to 17F \"Daughter\" for close to a decade.  We have a really close relationship.  \"Partner\" and I have raised her since she came to live with us due to her bio mom's behavior toward Daughter and life choices.  Daughter continues to have a lot of strain with bio mom, and she has a habit of trying to save people.  Without labeling it, we have discussed it as a topic of concern with her, and we have discussed creating healthier relationships and boundaries with people.  For a long time, that was an issue, but she has started to share some of our feelings with some recent behaviors of others.\n\n18F \"Friend\" came into our lives 5 years ago.  She was very shy, and would get upset very easily.  Sometimes these included anger outbursts at our dinner table, which was entirely unacceptable.  I told her it needed to stop.  Daughter just HAD to have Friend in her life, she had to help her.  It got to the point where Friend claimed to her mom that she had separation anxiety from Daughter and she had to be around her - the mom somehow agreed, which made our lives so much harder with Daughter.  Partner was kind of a coward (I don't say this to him, but it is the truth) and we ended up fighting a lot behind closed doors.  I hated our home.\n\nFriend lost her mind when Daughter went with her 3 older siblings out of town.  Friend was not invited and she threw a tantrum and trying everything to get invited.  When it was not working, she made Daughter cry and try to cancel the trip herself, and I told her absolutely not.  Friend is jealously guarded over Daughter and Daughter has put some of her friends on the back burner (including her oldest friend) and has no relationships where Friend doesn't have involvement.  Friend isn't exactly easy to get along with, so it has been a struggle on every relationship in Daughter's life.\n\nRecently Friend's grandparents (divorced) each invite Friend on vacation - she will only go with Daughter.  So Daughter uses gift money from Nanny to buy her own ticket and the grandma had already purchased a Disney package.  After that trip, they drive to Friend's grandfather's ranch and stay with him.  Daughter has been talking to a new boy during this time, and Friend starts getting really jealous, criticizing Daughter, belittling the relationship, and overall discouraging it.  His family invites her to visit them out of town.  Partner and I think it sounds great and said yes.  Friend tells Daughter \"So I take you on all these vacations (she paid for nothing) so you can just turn around go on vacation with someone else?\"  Friend continues to cause drama while Daughter is on vacation, and when she returns it progressively gets worse.  Friend refuses to meet now Boyfriend, but constantly criticized him and Daughter.  For the record, Daughter continued seeing Friend pretty much daily even after all of this.  Daughter and I clean the house on a Sunday night before Boyfriend's arrival back home and she tells Friend she can't hang out because she's cleaning (100% true).  Friend explodes and tells her she's a horrible person and a horrible friend among other things.  She goes to Daughter's other friends, including her oldest friend, and tries to get them all on her side before Daughter even knows anything is happening.  This continues and Daughter told Friend she needed time and space.  Friend continues to call to try to make up, then explodes on her, and the cycle repeats.  Most people in Daughter's life think she needs to stop communicating with Friend.  Also Boyfriend is great - there's zero reason to dislike the guy and we fully approve of him.  Friend has literally never even talked to him, and never met him because he goes to a private school in another city.\n\nAs bad as I feel for Daughter going through this, there is a little bit of relief.  She may be able to have normal relationships with people that do not cater to Friend.  However as most of us in Reddit Toxic Relationship groups know... people often return to their abuser.  Which that is what Friend is - a controlling, narcissistic, abuser whose damaged every relationship in Daughter's life.  \n\nPartner said we need to allow Daughter to do what she feels she needs to do.  I asked him if he would feel the same way if this was a man treating her this way, and he was silent.  I am at the tipping point where I cannot and will not control who Daughter communicates with, but I do not want it in our home.  I never want Friend in the house again.  I never want her to sit at my dinner table again.  I never want to offer food I work and pay for again.  I never want her to enjoy the comforts of the home I've helped to create again.  I never want to hear her bickering, yelling, or manipulating Daughter behind her bedroom door again.  I want our home to be a safe place.  I haven't had that for 5 years.\n\nI think I have to tell Daughter this, which I think will go over well right now.  It's a month from now when she's possibly forgiven her that I am concerned for, and Friend is suddenly in our home constantly again.  Am I going about this the wrong way?",

I'm young and healthy, but I do go to weekly therapy sessions so that's my recurring expense. I'm not sure if it's worth switching, I've always had PPO and paying everything up front is a little scary for me, even though I can afford to pay medical costs out of pocket. If I switch to HDHPD with HSA, I would plan to pay everything out of pocket and leave the funds in the HSA to grow. \n\nCould anyone help me see if I'm thinking about this correctly? \n\n||PPO Premera|Premera HDHP with HSA|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Premium|$0|$0|\n|Deductible|$200|$1500|\n|Out of Pocket Max|$1000|$2500|\n|Employer Contribution HSA||$1500|\n|Employee Contribution HSA||$2350 (to max out HSA)|\n|Therapy|$15 Copay only|90% after Deductible |\n|Annual Therapy Cost|$15 x 52 weeks = $780|$211 x 7 weeks = $1477 \\[which would pretty much be that $1500 Employer HSA contribution \\] $211 x 10% x 45 weeks = $950 -----> effective cost to me would be $950|\n|Assumption||(Provider says they can't tell me specifics unfortunately but my current bill says that the cost is 335 but becomes \\~$211 for in-network discount, of which I pay the $15 co-pay for. So I'm assuming I would be paying $211 until I hit the deductible, but I could be wrong here =/)|\n\nMy Tax Benefit from HSA would be that $2350 Employee Contribution x 49% Tax Rate = $1151.50\n\n\\[With a 32% Fed Tax Rate + 9.35% State Tax Rate + 7.65% FICA Tax Rate = 49% Total Tax Rate\n\nSo if I'm right in assuming that while I'd be paying more out of pocket for the HDHP plan, that it would still be smarter for me to go with the HDHP for the long term tax benefits from the HSA. Is this correct? Or should I be sticking with the PPO plan? \n\nThank you very much for any advice!",

    "selftext": "This concept is probably not new, it's probably completely unoriginal. It was inspired by the terrifying feeling of the world being an unpredictable place where too many scary things happen, too many things are out of your control, which goes along with the feeling of your own sanity collapsing. How do you cope in a world where torture exists, knowing in the back of your mind it could happen to you or a loved one?\n\nBut let me give some more \"trivial\" examples of \"too many things being out of ones' control?\" They may seem trivial compared to some of the really messed up things that happen in the world.. and yet when all these \"little\" things pile up, you might still feel your sanity collapsing into the ether.\n\nYou need to work in order to survive but might have too much social anxiety to work or even attend an interview. What should you do?\n\nYou're obligated to go to school, and yet the prospect of getting bullied terrifies you. And you don't want to go because it feels like school destroys what gifts you have, such as your sense of humor, your love of music. Plus the teacher seems like a terrifying tyrant. What should you do?\n\nYou come home and your parents aren't supportive, and it seems like there's no one who reliably has your back. What should you do?\n\nYou need social connections to be happy, and yet all you seem to be capable of is sabotaging those social connections. What to do?\n\nSomeone smugly answers \"get counselling/therapy\" and yet that seems too intimidating, or there's nothing available where you live. What to do?\n\nWith all that considered, my concept of God/luck/a higher power/whatever you want to call it could be summarized as follows: \"Even if you smash my sanity to a million pieces and scatter my mind across the ends of the Earth, I will remain calm knowing there is some glue holding the fort together.\"\n\nWhile this higher power may not be scientifically provable, it may potentially hold some psychological benefit. That's the whole point - to serve as a coping mechanism when other coping mechanisms are a) unavailable or b) just not working.\n\nMaybe I'm reinventing the wheel here. Is this just nihilism? I don't know.\n\nIf this were a religion, it would have no obligations. No pressuring its followers to start a family, and potentially hand down trauma onto the next generation. This is about YOUR sanity first and foremost. It starts with you.\n\nEnd of TED talk.",

Not even any scorch marks on the paper. I went through an almost full matchstick book, all in vain.\n\nI\u2019m so glad now that that happened. My TF and I had a conversation yesterday evening (yes, the night of the full moon in Pisces conjunct Saturn, during both of our first Saturn returns on top of everything else astrologically happening) and had a difficult, but deeply healing conversation that\u2019s been a long time coming.\n\nIt reaffirmed for both of us our deep love for each other (something that had been in doubt on both our ends, which caused each of us immense pain), while acknowledging that at this point in our lives, even though we\u2019ve both been catalysts for each other\u2019s growth in our relationship up til now, right now our active presence in each other\u2019s lives won\u2019t allow us to continue our growth journeys. So we\u2019re letting each other go to live our lives so that we can both heal and grow into who we\u2019re each meant to be, while acknowledging our eternal, unconditional love for each other and keeping things open for the future without placing any expectations on each other.\n\nAfter multiple separations and reunions that felt like heaven and hell, I feel so damn lucky that we\u2019ve both reached this point of surrender together in person. Nothing but peace and unconditional love.\n\nBefore last night I was so certain that I ruined everything\u2026I almost chased my TF away, seemingly permanently by her choice, to avoid risking more rejection and heartbreak. But following my heart and facing my fears for the particular lessons I\u2019m working to learn (vulnerability most of all) made all the difference.",

    "selftext": "I love listening to full albums. I've listened to about 20 this month. I didn't start until recently. I have a few that stand out that I'd love to share.\n\nSongs of a Dead Dreamer by DJ Spooky would be the first I recommend. It's totally designed to be listened to in full. The songs start with the ending of the last one. It's so amazing. It's completely instrumental and so full of emotion. I felt so many conflicting emotions and each time I listened a different song would stand out. Galactic Funk is amazing.I'm sure this album would be great on Psychedelics. It might bring up emotions you can't place though so be careful. Imo it's definitely worth owning on Vinyl. \n\nThe Visit by Loreena Mckenitt. This album for me is just beautiful. Her voice is intoxicating in my opinion. I love the mood of this album as well. The Lady of Shalott is a song that really stands out to me. It has a haunting in a good way quality.\n\nThe Trinity Sessions by Cowboy Junkies. This album is perfect for waking up to the sunrise with and drinking coffee to. I believe it was recorded in an old church as well. They have an amazing cover of Sweet Jane Imo. Also Blue Moon Revisited stands out. \n\nSteve Earle Live from Austin Texas-  I really like the way he sounds live. It's 17 songs. It's hard to pick a favorite from it. I recommend watching it on YouTube. I watch it when I'm alone and I start to feel the concert vibe. This is what I chose for him because it's a great selection of songs and if you haven't heard him before it's a great intro. I really like Sweet Little 66 and The Week of Living Dangerously from this album. Those are on the album Exit 0 as well. \n\nWitchtanic Hellucinations- Acid Witch\nThis album is pretty trippy and heavy and campy as well as spooky at the same time. Honestly it's fun. If you like listening to lyrics you might want to skip this though. However the instrumentals are amazing imo. \n\nWithin The Depths of A Darkened Forest- Autumn's Grey Solace\nThis album gives a floaty nightmarish yet relaxing vibe imo. I just love it. It has a mood that just makes me feel satisfied. This album is great to relax to imo. \n\nI hope someone finds something they love from this.

If you really want to make sure you are fully knowledgable on subject matter, there are thousands of free materials and websites that you can access to teach you all you need to know.

The one girl who we will call (f23) \u201cJessica\u201d I\u2019ve lived with in the past, we live well together and generally have 0 problems and I actually really enjoy being rough mates with them. My other roommate who we will call \u201cTatum\u201d (f24) is an old co worker of mine. Right around the time I was thinking about moving into the place Tatum breaks up with their girlfriend and asks to move into the house around the same time as me since we needed another roommate anyways. We said yes. For context, Tatum has 2 cats, I have 1, Jessica doesn\u2019t have any pets. \n\nIt\u2019s been about 3 months of us all living together and since the beginning me and Jessica have noticed Tatum does not take the best care of their cats. Litter boxes will go DAYS or even weeks without being scooped, so the whole main floor reeks like cat piss and litter. Tatum also just scoops the litter into an open cardboard box and let\u2019s weeks of scooped litter pile up.  One of Tatums cats has peed on mine and jessica\u2019s shoes and furniture multiple times. We brought this to Tatums attention, they apologized, offered to buy us new shoes (which never happened) and said they are trying to fix the problem. We have asked nicely multiple times to do something about the smell of the litter and pee that has seeped into the carpets, but time and time again Tatum does not do anything and the problem continues. This has escalated so far that the whole house smells so bad; I\u2019m embarrassed to have people over and me and Jessica don\u2019t wanna spend time anywhere else but our rooms. \n\nWe brought it up AGAIN recently, and Tatum flipped out and sent us a really passive aggressive text, telling us to not assume they have all the time in the world to clean because they work full time. WE ALL WORK FULLTIME AND ME AND JESSICA HAVE 0 ISSUES KEEPING COMMUNAL AREAS CLEAN. I even keep my cat + her litter box in my room so my roommates don\u2019t have to deal with it. I truly cannot emphasize how bad our house smells, on top of this all, Tatum has not vacuumed the carpet ONCE since they moved in and it gets covered in cat hair, which leaves me and jessica to vacuum every week. I want to stop doing Tatums chores for them, but if I don\u2019t the house would be absolutely disgusting. This includes taking out their garbage, and putting their dishes away. \n\nWe have offered Tatum our help, we\u2019ve offered suggestions, like getting a closed lid garbage can for the scooped litter, keeping their cats in their room etc. \n\nIs this enough of reasoning to ask them to move out when our lease is up in october?\n\n Jessica and I will have no problems finding a new roommate so i\u2019m not worried about that. But time and time again mine and jessica\u2019s stuff is getting covered in cat pee and we can\u2019t even enjoy the house that is supposed to be collectively ours. I don\u2019t even consider Tatum a friend of mine anymore because everyday they continue to disrespect me and Jessica. \n\nPlease give me some advice :(",

    "selftext": "Hey I read this guys article about his he was hearing voices for 20 years saying they were going to come and get him. Well in his case he got rid of them by doing some mental exercises. Well my question is this, what and how can thought broadcasting occure?  Because I have had some crazy things for 13 years in my mind. I hear whispers and thoughts that are not my own. These voices like this guy I'm talking about keep saying for 13 years that they are going to come and get me. Now these voices claim to be people I know. Like they have taken of names of people I'm aware of. Do I have paranoid delusions or what?\n\nCan this happen to me? And anyone? I shall list why my delusions keep fighting me. I will list these because some of these things that have happened just like this reddit says about directed energy weapons.\n\n1. 6 years ago - feeling like the old neighbor was using some microwave weapon because I was heating up and getting zapped. - Could also be do to the fact I was on method. I heard some sort of power supply. I could tell it was either 3 phase or out of phase power supply upstairs.\n\n2. I know it goes beyond just microwave weapons. These other weapons can be an implant and having full control of the body and mind. Includes even giving people heart attacks essentially (,weapon that remotely kills a human).\n\n3. They can see through your eyes and even experiences all of your bodies senses.\n\n4. Now I've researched my spasms in body from head to toe and using meth can cause this (vitamin deficiency) but are they able to also control your body functions. So is that possible? I don't think so.\n\n5. Tons more I can think of but I'll start with that.\n\nThis would be the ultimate spy and will deem these people as the wackiest people know to man. Just creaps and violators of privacy. \n\n6. Not to mention but I think these groups are mass murders, that would make them serial killers.\n\nSo what are your thoughts and I don't mean to be asking the spy's spying on me.\n\nThey say their the mob and gang members.\n\nAlso they have spread all kinds of lies to a lot a lot of people here on the streets to say I'm some sort of fucking pervert. oh yeah. So they have made me into this by injecting thoughts and oh yeah images into the mind.\n\n7. Thought insertion and then can rebroadcast what I'm saying but through their thoughts being injected into my mind. \n\nnow this might be some new tech that all y'all don't know yet.\n\nBut because of all the lies they have spread about me, I'm just waiting to bash some skulls. But this is not a threat so don't delete this post.",

Even when I work them out to get them stronger, they tense and become even more tight. I\u2019ve had Physio, chiro, massage and more done on them and everyone just says stretch and strengthen them. \n\nToday I was about to go for a job and I was warming up my doing single leg RDL\u2019s with a 25lbs kettlebell. I did some other stretches and then proceeded to do a standing tree pose where I placed my right foot over my left knee whilst standing and then going into a squat to get a stretch in. While doing so I felt my knee pop so loud and the sensation of it was so intense. \n\nI immediately sat down thinking I hurt my knee but to my surprise my knee was fine but my hamstring tightness on my right leg was gone. I have no idea how this is correlated and I was hoping to gain some insight. I\u2019ve never had knee tightness or any issues with my knee so I\u2019m surprised that popping or ?realignment? resulted in instant tightness relief. \n\nI tried doing the same process on my left leg which is also tight but nothing happened. \n\nSo does anyone know how the knee popping is correlated to chronic hamstring tightness. I\u2019m surprised no therapist caught it. \n\nAnd does anyone know how to actively release it so I can do my left leg as well? \n\nThanks!",

I personally don\u2019t have an issue with Jeremy, I find him tolerable in small doses.. but I can totally see why others find him so annoying. \n\nI feel like Joe has a vibe around him whenever he\u2019s with Jeremy like he\u2019s letting out this huge sigh\u2026 like he has no choice but to be stuck with this guy. It\u2019s like the jock at high school that has no choice but to hang out with the socially inept maths dork, because he needs him to help him study and get the grades. He literally resents every second in his company. \n\nJeremy js definitely a pain in the ass though. He constantly sets himself up for these little truth bomb revelations that don\u2019t amount to anything, and has a weird way of speaking in that he\u2019s almost excited by what HE is about to say next.. and then says nothing remotely interesting or exciting. He also unfortunately has a general air about him of a total lack of sincerity and believability. Like the ultimate snake lol salesman. \n\nHonestly speaking I feel like if this topic opens way up in the coming years, I think Corbell will struggle to keep himself relevant. He\u2019s done well so far as he\u2019s a relatively big fish in a small pond. However, if disclosure were to happen, I think he would find that to change immediately. Unfortunately I just don\u2019t see that Jeremy has enough universal likeability to stay a relevant figure in this field. \n\nJust me? Open to hear other opinions!",

Before I say my average I would like it to be known that my extra curriculars are particularly lacking with nearly no club, athletic and community involvement. I'm going into my junior year having finished BC's equivalent of Advanced functions with a 97%, grade 11 level chemistry at 94% and concurrent studies experience of first semester calculus with a focus in engineering. For the following year I will be taking AP Calculus, Chemistry 12(SCH4U equivalent), AP physics 1, 11th grade computer science and AP physics 2 and 12th grade computer science in my senior year. I currently have 12 university credits with a 3.75 GPA and am currently enrolled in an engineering introduction course, programming introduction course and a general chemistry course with a focus in engineering applications. My questions is what are should I be most focused on improving? Is it the very lacking extracurriculars? If so is there any advice or tips in how I should choose my extracurriculars. I heard that the admission officers look for certain traits such as leadership. I am currently eligible for a leadership position in my Taekwondo Dojang, should I take it?",

    "selftext": "Hey all, this is going to be a rather long post, but if some professionals wouldn\u2019t mind lending me some time it would be much appreciated. For some stats about myself, I am a 5\u201911\u201d 140lbs white male, currently 20 years old. Minimal drug use with absolutely none over the past 2-3 years. I would like to start by saying I have a family history of depression, panic disorder, OCD, ASD, and inattentive ADHD. As of a few days ago, I was diagnosed with OCD, and was also diagnosed with mild anxiety and depression about 2 years ago. I am definitely no stranger to mental health issues as I recall taking Zoloft as early as 8 years old for a period of time.\n\nAbout 6 months prior to my anxiety/depression diagnosis, I was hit with an intense derealization episode which has since been coming and going up to the present day. This initial episode occurred almost immediately after moving out of my house at 18 years old. After being diagnosed with anxiety/depression, I went through treatment involving a combination of Prozac, therapy, and some lifestyle changes. I would say the treatment was overall positive as symptoms of anxiety/depression popped up very minimally following that, and even if they did I had a pretty easy time managing them. This was until the past month or so.\n\nWhile I would consider the treatment successful, I was left with derealization that comes and goes frequently as I have mentioned before. In addition to the derealization, other symptoms have started to arise over the past year or so which go as follows:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Checking things repetitively (door locks, light switches)\n* Very hard to pay attention to conversations\n* Can\u2019t focus on tasks (especially reading)\n* Trouble getting out of bed\n* Bad forgetfulness (especially short term memory)\n* Depressive episodes that usually only last up to a week\n* Feeling of panic attacks setting in\n* Constant dialogue, music, etc. in head\n* Spacing out a lot\n* Fear of germs\n* Obsessions over illnesses (both physical and mental)\n* Constant fidgeting\n* Sporadic emotional highs and lows throughout the day\n* Pressure but no pain in front of head\n\nI would like to note that these symptoms are in no particular order, but some symptoms such as nearing panic attacks have fluctuated since ending anxiety/depression treatment. Also, I would like to place special emphasis on the obsession over illnesses, which has caused me great grief, stress and anxiety over the past few months. This ranges from fear of getting Lyme disease, melanoma, and many others. My most recent spiral has been caused by a fear of developing schizophrenia, which I am still actively in at the moment and fear a great deal. As a matter of fact, my most recent visit to the psychiatrist in which I was diagnosed with OCD was initiated by me due to the fact that my fear of schizophrenia has been causing me such an immense amount of anxiety. This anxiety has caused me to become much more stressed overall, and my depressive and suicidal thoughts (never have attempted and never will) have since come back.\n\nMy psychiatrist\u2019s recent diagnosis of OCD calmed my fears almost none, and I am extremely apprehensive to start medication treatment again as my first month on Prozac was absolute hell. I also greatly fear the emotional blunting that an SSRI may cause for me again. I can\u2019t help but feel that OCD isn\u2019t the only problem here, and even if it was, I am so nervous to start anxiety/depression related treatment again. I am forever left with the \u2018What if?\u2019 question in my mind, whether it be related to having some other undiagnosed mental disorder or not being able to get treated properly.\n\nLike I said, if any professionals have any insight on what this may be or advice on what route I should take, please let me know. I am 100% open to seeking treatment even if it means having to do medication therapy, but I don\u2019t know where to even begin. Thank you!",

    "selftext": "Since the start of the holidays my gf and i have started arguing alot. It was always over little things but i just realised she stopped doing a bunch of things she used to such as sending x\u2019s on most messages and saying i love you at-least once a day, giving me compliments. I continue to do all of these things but i kept feeling like i wasn\u2019t getting it back. She didn\u2019t make any plans with me and instead she kept hanging out with others such as her best friend, her boy bsf and her family friend and then shed say weird reasons for why shes busy such as shes waiting for a package to arrive. \n\nAdditionally, she kept going on omegle and she has added two boys on her snapchat that she is now close friends with. I did not say anything as i had a conversation with myself.\n\nShe would also talk abt what her and her boy bsf are talking about and she kept making plans with him.\n\nAdditionally, she kept posting on her stories about a boy called Conrad from a tv series. She would go on abt how much shes in love with him. And one day she told me i was more like Jeremiah and not rlly like Conrad. Her reasoning was that its because Jeremiah is sweeter. Still this just got on my nerves a bit as it made me feel inadequate.\n\nAlso, she kept posting things on her story about things she likes about guys and things she likes them to wear and they weren\u2019t very me.\n\nShe has also added back a boy who was rlly mean to me on snap and is now friends with. And also her ex boyfriend who kept creeping on her during our relationship.\n\nOne day i let her know that i had had some rlly bad news all in one day. One of my beloved pets died and additionally my dad was arrested. To this she said, \u201ci don\u2019t know what im supposed to say\u201d\n\nAlso the other she was annoyed at me bc we were at a birthday party and she thought i enjoyed dancing with my friends more than with her. I reassured her that i loved dancing with her i just was a bit upset at one point bc she had just shouted at me outside to \u201cshut up\u201d followed by \u201cstupid\u201d because i interrupted her. She apologised and said she\u2019s sorry she was moody but it made her feel like she wasn\u2019t important. She then proceeded to post a story of a screenshot of her and her boy bsf chat of him saying \u201cyou are important\u201d and her saying \u201ci appreciate you so much\u201d.\n\nFinally, we used to call almost everyday and we have not called in over a month now. She has assured me she is not ignoring me or avoiding me but she has gone on omegle so many times and i feel this may make me sound like an asshole but she could have been calling me.\n\nIve read up alot online and everywhere says that these are all sogns she\u2019s falling out of love. Additionally the fact shes asked for us not to do stuff (we weren\u2019t having sex just making out and such) and she\u2019s asked if we could just not kiss as much. And i used to say abt once a week that i would join her in bed whilst we were getting ready to sleep and shes started to say no. She has told me that she doesn\u2019t wanna kiss as much bc she feels insecure abt my love for her due to the arguments.\n\nI just don\u2019t rlly know what im doing wrong i support her and i drop flowers at her door and i give her space if she wants it and i text her lots and tell her i love her and that she\u2019s gorgeous.\n\nShe has also been sending me blank snaps whilst posting stories of herself and shes started to wear less conservative clothing which is okay i think bc ig like i cant control what she does or wears.\n\nI just want a second opinion on this please and sorry i know this is not great english at all or anything and maybe not laid out well",

I kept getting ready for the climax - for stuff to really start happening and it just never did. I finally realized I was waiting for a Sanderlanche.\n\nWhen I finished I was so unsatisfied I had zero desire to read the next book (also because the 12+ year wait for the final book makes me not want to invest).\n\nI\u2019ve had a few other similar experiences with other series. I\u2019m not sure I can enjoy other books now that I know what a climax can really look like. \n\nTwice through the Cosmere now I\u2019m trying to decide to go around again (so many good details on re reads) or keep trying other series\n\nAny suggestions on Authors/series that have real climaxes?",

Other than red meat and significant sweets, I\u2019ve *tried* most foods I ate before surgery, including raw veggies and lots of fruit.\n\nEarlier on, when allowed, the small Kraft macaroni and cheese bowls were a frequent staple, and sat fine. I can also eat rice fine.\n\nI tried some ramen noodles after that at some point, assuming that if macaroni and cheese sat fine then noodles would too. I became incredibly nauseated and barely kept myself from throwing up, and that was only eating a few bites. If subsided in less than an hour.\n\nI thought it might be a fluke, and last night I tried an Annie Chun\u2019s sesame peanut noodle bowl. I was throwing up and felt like dying for almost 3 hours. Never, ever again.\n\nI can\u2019t begin to understand why noodles make me so sick, but was curious if this was a no-go for anyone else?",

She was a marine and could have crossed paths with Dragon that way. We also don't know her last name so she could be Garp's daughter. As for why she never raised Luffy it could be that it was too risky so she asked her dad to do it and stayed in the East Blue so she could one day see her son.\n\nI also like this idea because I want Arlong to return and to be worse than ever and I think a good way to do that would be by reopening some old wounds. It's also possible Garp never did anything to Arlong because he never knew I mean they probably weren't on speaking terms at the time and Garp was probably concerned about Luffy turning out like his parents. \n\nBell-mere also retired young and I think that's due to her involvement with Dragon likely she was on some sort of mission and fell for him. Then she went to Garp for help, and he pulled strings, but they still weren't on speaking terms. Bell-mere is also similar to Luffy she was a troublemaker yet became a Marine (likely forced into it by Garp) so there's a bit of a parallel to Luffy as he was raised to be a marine but became a pirate.",

    "selftext": "I hope it's ok if I ask about this in here. I attend another 12 step programme for family members of addicts and alcoholics (I would just prefer to ask about this in here rather than their subreddit, to avoid being too identifying). \n\nI've had some difficulty finding people in the programme who I feel happy with and vice versa to do outreach. I find most people in the programme are either codependent or narcissistic (which makes sense, it's the result of trauma), so it's difficult to have good boundaries with people and sometimes relationships can become toxic fast. I found one lady who I meet with regularly online, we go through some of the literature and share what comes up. It felt like it was going well at first and I found it helpful. Early on she brought up that she didn't want us to act like each other's therapists, after I had overshared a bit and asked for her advice. I felt a bit embarrassed but I respected her for bringing that up rather than just ghosting me or something, and I was mindful of how long I was sharing, and I stopped asking her for advice.\n\nThe problem is, a few weeks later she then started to do the same thing - treated me like I was a free therapist. In one of the sessions, after I asked how her week had been expecting a quick reply, she spoke for 25 minutes about all sorts of things, some of it was about her work and not about recovery, and it was specific to her field so it made no sense to me, but she just refused to stop. I kept trying to close it down so we could start reading but every attempt she just bulldozed past. I started to feel stressed and like a hostage and wanted to just end the call but didn't want to do anything dramatic. Eventually after half an hour she stopped, and then at the end of the session, I brought it up, as kindly and tactfully as I could, that I felt we should go back to having more structure for these outreach sessions. She responded in a stubborn, denying and defensive way about it.  I absolutely cannot have someone monologuing at me for 30 minutes, not caring if I even understand what they're saying. It felt like she was taking advantage of me being a listening ear, so I definitely had to establish a boundary there. In the past I was surrounded by narcissistic people who bullied me and bossed me around, and my natural tendency is to be fairly quiet and passive. A big part of my own recovery is to speak up for myself and set better boundaries so it felt unsettling for her to react so negatively to me trying to have a boundary. I felt disappointed that she wasn't able to respond in a calm, mature way the way I had when she'd given me some feedback.\n\nWe couldn't meet up for several weeks but we've met again recently, and I get the impression she feels a bit tense and aggrieved by our last session. She was a bit frosty and picky about how we did things. I get the impression she wants to dictate how the session runs - she's sort of acting as if I'm the one who was doing something wrong rather than her, unable to take any criticism at all. She says she's only free two times per week, one of which doesn't suit me and the other is inconvenient, so I've been meeting her at a inconvenient time for me because she's so inflexible. She's a lot older than me but at times seems very petulant and emotionally immature. I do also find her funny and wise at times, and feel disappointed in how this outreach has evolved. I even considered asking her to be my sponsor at one point until I noticed her intolerance and inflexibility about a lot of things.\n\nI know I have to decide this for myself, but I thought it would help to share to get other people's thoughts on it. I'm wondering whether to keep going with it or just end the outreach sessions. ",

But I am *also* reading a lot of posts on here and r/puppy101 that the biting doesn't stop until after 1 year old? Sometimes longer?\n\nWe got Milo when he was 8 weeks, at the same time I was in my second trimester of pregnancy. We were reconsidering getting a puppy because of that, but did a lot of research and were sure we could get enough training in before our baby arrived. Even our breeder reassured us that we had plenty of time, so we went ahead with the purchase. But I am really starting to worry about his biting and having a baby in the house. I really was not aware it was going to be to THIS extent. He's also not that great with our 9 year old son, but for other reasons we are working on (getting the dog hyped up and rough play). \n\nWe are taking him for one *sometimes* two 1 hour walks daily, training, and I can fully admit he might not have enough mental stimuli in the home so getting some treat puzzles etc. is on my list. Same goes for naps, right now he is unable to get much quality sleep in during the day as my son is still on summer break; but will be back in school within a few days so he will get more sleep then (hopefully lol). He is 100% crate trained, and sleeps from 10-11pm until 6am when my partner wakes up for work. \n\nRe-homing him is not an option, but I really need other suggestions to nip this behavior in the bud as soon as possible. Also, has anyone else gone through a similar scenario?  \n\nPlease no judgement as I have come to the realization that this might not have been great timing, but he is part of the family now so we are just looking for help to ensure we have a good outcome as our family grows. \n\n[Pic of the minions for tax ](https://preview.redd.it/js9qm5d9cjlb1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c04bed6f9d7e3047ca47570bfc697c87caa9ca89)",

But otherwise I feel like you miss a lot of interactions if you're not activaly pursuing them as a romance option which sucks because I sometimes I just want to be friends LOL \n\nThis is my second time romancing Shart (and I will not stop until there's a farm ending), so I haven't been able to see a lot of the romance scene from the other characters so far and don't get me wrong, I already have like 5 other playthroughs planned to romance the companions LOL But yeah it's just really dissapointing to me that I can't build like friendship that feels real with the other companions I'm not romancing!!!!!

I attempted suicide twice earlier this year and am looking to get the scars covered, but won\u2019t be able financially to get a tattoo by one of my previous tattoo artists for at least another year or more.\n\nThe scars are about 3x3\u201d and are in between smaller tattoos I have on my wrist as well, so it would probably make the most sense to just cover all of it and forget about what happened. I\u2019m mentally in SUCH a better place and really just want to leave my attempt in the past and feel like I can move on from it in all the ways I can, including covering the scars.\n\nI\u2019m more in the northwest suburbs, but willing to do a bit of driving to make this work\n\nI appreciate any responses and help/feedback!",

Then I started making planners in canva as well. I didn't have too high of expectations for my shop I mean I know my stuffs not the most trendy. but to my surprise I was able to make over 20 sales in my first month and made over $240 in revenue. but the kicker is I spent literally all of that money on ads. \n\nI was getting decent consistent sales. I did notice a drop in views over the weekends but I just figured it's because the niche I'm in. I was spending 10$ a day on ads and was still making profit so I decided to bump it up to 13$ about a week ago and ever since then I haven't seen a single sale. my shop has never gone this long without getting a sale and I know it's pretty new still but I was just wondering if this up and down is normal for etsy shops in my niche. also has anyone had any success with pinterest in my niche? I've noticed most digital planners on pinterest are free so I cant imagine people actually make profit from there.\n\nI was also wondering if there's anything in my shop that's not ideal to have or if something is wrong to please let me know. I've spent a lot of time on my shop recently and would love some helpful tips on getting started as well. \n\nhttps://honeydewpages.etsy.com",

My (dumb) question is how the heck does the odometer disclosure statement work? Do I need to print out the VSD 333 odometer form, then take it to a local Nissan dealership (mine was purchased at Myrtle Beach Nissan) and have someone there check the reading and sign it for me?\n\nI can't find any information about this online at all. When I was at the DMV here to get my DL a few days, I asked an employee about how the odometer form works and told me that I straight up didn't need it at all. I kind of doubt that considering that its listed as required on the website! I'm going to call them ASAP to try to speak to someone else who can clarify for me.\n\nThank you for any help!

    "selftext": "Hi all, I'm new to this sub, but I wanted to share my experience with (almost) resolving a 20-year, daily headache to migraine problem in the hopes it helps someone else. I still get a migraine about once a week, but it has improved greatly. I had been diagnosed with photosensitivity brought on by \"Bear Tracks\" or CHRPE. \n\nMy migraine trigger has always been light, and by the time the afternoon rolled around on an average day, my eyes would just feel...exhausted. I have trouble explaining it, but all I can really say is that they felt very tired, like they were being overworked. It wasn't that they were dry, or that I was tired in general, if any of you can relate. It's around this point the headaches start and I attempt to crush it early with excedrin, close my eyes and rub my sockets (you know the sweet spot lol) for about 20 minutes. Sometimes it helped, sometimes it didn't.\n\nAnywho, after dealing with this nonsense forever and loads of examinations over the years, my eye doctor found something accidentally. He was maneuvering my head into place on one of those torture devices and was putting a good amount of pressure on the upper part my left eye. Once set, he shined the light on in there. \n\nI usually have a LOT of trouble not blinking during the examination because the light they use is just way too overwhelmingly bright for me, but this time I was fine, it certainly didn't seem as bright as usual. Then he moved over to the right eye and shined the light. It felt worse than staring into the sun, and I could not keep my eye open even a little, and I informed him it was entirely too bright, and to please use the same light he used on my left eye. He told me it was the same light and sat back to think for a minute, then he wanted to try something...he put steady pressure on the upper part of my right eye for about 15-20 seconds and tried the light again. It was not nearly as bright as it had been a moment earlier...\n\nHis leading theory was that the ducts that carry some of the oils to my eye might be blocked. My eyes were never dry, so they were getting moisture, but some of the necessary oils were just not being included like they should be. Thinking back on it, I hadn't had any trace of morning \"eye gunk\" \"eye boogers\" or \"sleep\" (rheum) since I was a child, which happens because of a buildup of oils.\n\nThe treatment plan was easy after that. I used a bruder mask twice a day for 10 min, rubbed the upper part of my eyes with warm/hot water in the shower, and used carboxymethylcelulose drops 4 times a day or to fill in gaps when my eyes started to feel \"tired\" again. After only 1 month, my daily headache/migraines were basically gone, and I started to get the occasional morning eye gunk again. 20 freaking years man... \n\nFeel free to comment or PM me with any questions! \nTL;DR My migraines are largely triggered by jacked-up blinker fluid.",

    "selftext": "37M. I\u2019m going to provide as much context as possible, I\u2019m married to 40F, she\u2019s 4 months pregnant with our first child, this was/is my first child as well. She has no children from any other marriages and neither do I (or so I thought).\n\nI live in Chicago, US. I moved here when I was about 20ish (?) before moving to Chicago I was living in Iowa US. \n\nIn Iowa I was dating a girl, first girl I ever dated. I think I was about 18 when we first started dating, so it was a two-year relationship. I know this will seems like a \u201ctypical reddit story\u201d but long story short she cheated on me with some guy, walked in on them. Yelled at her, she cried, blah blah. \n\nI moved to Chicago with the help of my parents shortly after. Lived in Naperville, Went to Wheaton college. Concentrated in Mechanical engineering, got my undergraduate. Got away from college met my wife through a friend, chased her for a while took her out, she had me whipped, proposed she said yes and now we live happy ever after.\n\nMy family does still live in Iowa by the way. Regarding \u201cthe girl\u201d I\u2019m not sure. I also want to state that I\u2019m over that, it was 17 years ago. People change blah blah. \n\nI also want to say I only use three social medias, YouTube, Facebook and Reddit. Also, I never change my username.\n\nYou can basically see where this is going.\n\nI got a message from her maybe a week ago. She started of small talking, asked me how I was doing, complementing my wife. I was creeped out, didn\u2019t know how she found me, but I was also intrigued on what she wanted. \n\nI also want to mention that I did tell my wife as soon as I got a message. \n\nTurns out she had a kid, assumed that the dad was the guy she slept with. Turns out he\u2019s not \u201caccording to her\u201d She apologized for what she did, didn\u2019t know what to say to that so I just said \u201cthanks\u201d. She asked if I\u2019d be willing to \u201ctalk to them\u201d if they were mine. \n\nI think this is all moving way too fast. If the child is mine, they most likely are 17-18 years old. The dad who\u2019s been in that kid's life is their dad, I\u2019m not at all. \n\nMy wife is also conflicted, this is something so new I genuinely don\u2019t know how to feel. \n\nTLDR: Ex reached out to me claiming she had my kid, I\u2019m not sure how to feel. I don\u2019t want any troubles in my marriage. WIBTA, if I decide not to be in the kid's life?\n\nI also want to mention that this happened about a week ago, I just left her on read and I just don't know what to do.",

    "selftext": "Reposting because I'm not sure why but some people are telling me it was deleted....however no notification or messages from any mods or bots. If there is something wrong with my post I will gladly fix it, but someone has to actually tell me first. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPart 2-\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo she had a lot of demands about the space itself before moving in, and we soon found out she had demands for us as well. Maybe it was because of her fragile emotional state at the time, maybe it was due to her being neurodivergent, but she didn't seem to have a sense of what was appropriate behavior when living with a family who is taking you in. She kept asking us for our time, that she wanted to do things with us but was afraid to ask, I told her my days off and that I was always open to anything she wanted to suggest. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo the first thing we did together was she brought crab to the dinner table, and explained that it is her comfort food so she would like to share with us, which was a sweet sentiment. \n\nHowever, in all the things she brought, she didn't actually own any tools to crack and open the crab. So she sat at the table, with my children across from her, holding a large kitchen knife and repeatedly slamming the handle down on the crab, then trying to crack at it with her bare hands, twisting at the legs, making a mess everywhere. \n\nMy husband, who is a professional chef with nearly 25 years of experience in Japanese cuisine which is very heavy on seafood, offered to take it and prepare it for her and everyone to eat more easily. She refused, telling him it was more fun to play with your food and was encouraging our children to do so as well. She then laid a crab leg on our bare table, and raised the knife handle high in the air to give it more force, and at that point my husband stopped her, and told her that we had just bought that table a few months ago (we were eating at the coffee table up until then) and she started saying \"No, I wasn't going to hit anything\" and he was exasperated and told her she had a haole attitude. Japanese culture, along with Asian and Hawaiian culture (we live in Hawaii), respect the animals they use for food and do not waste, or more importantly, play with food. He told her she was being very disrespectful and she then started rapid firing \"Why? Why? WHY?!\" at him which is hard for him to come back to because he does not speak English very well. \n\nShe went back into her room, and later, we did try to all talk it out and my husband sincerely apologized for using a slur, but after that he wanted to keep his distance from her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStill, we did keep attempting to have positive interactions and include her in things. A few nights later, we were watching anime in the living room and invited her to join us. She sat down on the couch and immediately asked my husband to move the couch, because the way she was turning her head to see the TV was giving her neck pain. We kind of exchanged a look, but moved it anyway. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen one morning, as kids do, they were being slow and not getting ready for school in time. We had already streamlined the morning routine so basically all they had to do was dress, eat, brush teeth, get their lunch and water bottle, put on shoes and go. We suggested getting up earlier but they didn't want to do that. But they were not getting ready and getting to school on time, and my husband finally raised his voice at them that morning and told them if they were not going to make the effort to go on time, he would not make the effort to take them. They started crying and begging him to take them, and this is when she burst out of her room and stomped loudly into the kitchen, and SCREAMED at them \"YOU ARE BEING TOO F\\*CKING LOUD! I FEEL UNSAFE AND I HAVE A RIGHT TO FEEL SAFE!\" before going back to her room and slamming the door, still shouting and ranting to herself. \n\nMy husband got a text later from her that said \"Can you please not shout before 10AM because it triggers my PTSD, thank you!\" of course, we made an effort to accommodate her, being as quiet as possible in the mornings. However I found it was kind of odd that she just screamed angrily at them, which scared them, and then claimed she was scared and concerned for the kids and it was triggering her. After this,  my daughter started keeping distance from her as well, not seeing her as a trustworthy adult anymore.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd then there was the ongoing issue of parking. It seemed like every day there was drama surrounding her beat up and broken car. And even though we lived in a highly walkable neighborhood with reliable public transportation as well as bike lanes, she would continually choose to use her car every time she wanted to go a few blocks, and raise a big fuss about there being no parking when she got back. She had it towed because she parked in our clearly marked 4 hour guest stalls, it got vandalized in a rash of property crimes that happened on our street one night, just one drama after another that we somehow got the brunt of. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne day, she wanted to go to the supermarket which was a 10 minute walk away, to get some juice and ingredients for dinner. She was bringing her wagon out the door and stopped expectantly, and looked at us, and asked my husband if he could take his car out of the parking garage and put it in her spot to save it until she gets back. We kind of looked at her in disbelief, and told her sorry, but no. She stood there and stared at us,  and then asked why. I told her we don't feel comfortable, and we're allowed to say no. Meanwhile my husband is starting to feel horrible because this is about his injured shoulders and this whole ordeal is very painful and traumatic for him. She keeps asking why, and finally she starts SHOUTING at us both, telling her that EVERY roommate she has EVER had until now ALWAYS did this for her. She then stormed out, loudly ranting as she went down the hall and rode the elevator that we were being absolutely unreasonable and not helping her, and she was doing US a favor by living in this place. I later texted her reminding her about my husband's condition and that reacting angrily when someone turns down a favor and shouting at them is not acceptable behavior and we are allowed to have boundaries just as much as she is. She later apologized to me, but not one word to my husband, to his face or by text. He started to avoid interaction with her entirely after this. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen her car (and several others) were vandalized on the street, she asked me for the manager's contact info. I later found out from my husband and from the manager that she had come up to him and asked to see the camera footage from last night. When he asked her nicely to file a police report so that he could work together to pull the appropriate footage, she started to scream and cry, and demanded that he show her all the camera footage right now. He again calmly tried to explain that he is willing to help but there is a legal procedure, he can't just show anyone all the camera footage on demand. She was shouting at him, pointing at a camera she thought was filming the spot her car was at (it wasn't, we only have cameras covering the property, not the street)she then yelled angrily at him that he wasn't going to help and no one is helping her, and stormed off. She never came back and apologized to him later after she was calm. He told us we it might be a good idea to have her move out sooner than later, and again, like an idiot, I still wanted to give her a chance. \n\nmore in part 3!",

    "selftext": "I\u2019m trying to decide which part I should upgrade at the moment. It\u2019s either the gpu(1080ti) or the cpu(R53600). I can definitely afford the cpu but the gpu is a bit of a stretch but I should still be able to. I was thinking either a 3070 or a 5800x. I think I\u2019m good right now but I\u2019d like to upgrade something for better gaming soon. I\u2019m curious how the 1080ti holds up. Is it comparable to any of the 3000 series or am I far behind? I also play on a 1080p monitor btw. I\u2019m also confused because I always head 1080ti might have been ahead of it\u2019s time but isn\u2019t it like generations behind?\n\nThe R53600 has been a magical cpu. Carried me this entire time. But starting to think it\u2019s close to the minimum requirement soon for games. I\u2019ve been looking at a R75800x and like what I\u2019m seeing. It\u2019s also a lot cheaper to upgrade the cpu than the gpu from what I\u2019m seeing. I do have a b450 max board so it can take the new cpu out the box.\n\nIdk let me know what you guys think? Cpu or gpu? Maybe wait for a sale soon?",

It wasn't that. I'm happy he was trying to better himself, I just needed him to be present when he was supposed to be with me. \nI spend all my time alone unless at work, I don't want to do anything, I'm tired all the time.

I was told that they did not have my trailer anywhere in their records, so I would need to pay $30 to have someone come out, change the lock on one of the boxes and I would recieve the key.  Took a couple weeks and then I got the call that my key was ready. Here is where the real fun begins. \n\nI get to my box and the key work. I called the post office and they weren't sure what happened. The lock was then changed again, two weeks later and I was provided a new set of keys, excellent. The keys worked this time, I start changing everything to my new address. Three weeks later I put the key in the lock, nothing. It's not working again. I called the post office and they didn't know what happened. More time passes and I was told that the box they assigned to me was actually a mistake and belonged to someone else. \n\nSo here we are, maybe 8 months later of this back and forth of me calling the post office almost weekly, trying to get an answer on when I will have my mailbox for them to tell me they are still working on it. I found out who my original box belonged to and it turns out they have just been taking all my mail and leaving it on top of the unit. This has caused me SEVERAL problems missing important mail and I'm desperate to get his resolved. I've gone as high as the post master at my local post office and don't know who else to turn to.

    "selftext": "We dated for 1.5 years. We are both people that like to take things slow and at one point I may have said that I\u2019m not a fan of physical touch. We had our first kiss 6 months into the relationship. There would be occasional cuddles and kisses good bye and hugs but that was it. There wasn\u2019t even any making out. We\u2019d sleep in the same bed even and hold hands. He (30M) comes from a conservative, religious family and I (30F) was his first girlfriend so at first I didn\u2019t think much of it.\n\n  \nWe recently were at a party where his old college friend had mentioned he used to sleep in one of their mutual friend\u2019s (who has now since come out) bed all the time. When I heard that-- and if we add on all the other things- the fact that he likes to get his nails painted for fun and our slow physical progression- I let my insecurities get the best of me so I brought up the fact that he used to sleep in his friend's bed during college. His defense was that the friend had the largest, most comfortable bed. He also specifically jumped to saying that he's into women multiple times. He then told me that he doesn't believe in premarital sex because of God, however, he no longer goes to church and has left his small group for a few years now. When I asked if he's ever been into men before, he said no. He then tells me that he does have low libido and that's the reason why he has so many female (platonic) friends because he's not trying to hook up with them.\n\n  \nWhen I told him that a sexless marriage doesn't work, he told me that we don't need to have sex to be good parents (because he knows I want kids in the future) and also said that there are sex therapists that can help.  \n\n\n  \nI am so freaking confused by some of the things he has said. Was I wrong for questioning his sexuality? (he was the one that actually brought it up directly....I just asked him why he used to sleep in his friend's bed and he jumped to that conclusion and defended himself.) I felt so bad for a few weeks that I even asked, but in hindsight, I don't think it was that outrageous or disrespectful of a question because it came from a place of genuine concern.\n\n  \nWe did end up breaking up- and not just for the above reasons. There was more to it but I just wanted to know if I was totally crazy or wrong to think or even question him.",

However I went to bed and woke up really upset as my sister (21F) had been really horrible to me, my mum and my other bridesmaids. I think she thinks it was funny, and I\u2019m sure it was just immaturity, but she doesn\u2019t know how much it hurt me and I don\u2019t know what to do. \n\nIt was mostly just pulling nasty faces and giving disapproving glances, she said nothing positive on the day, refused to do a speech or any maid of honour duties after asking to be maid of honour, told me that my husbands family (who she just met) like her better than me, telling my mum to stop dancing because she looked stupid, calling my other bridesmaids bitches and glaring at them on the dance floor. We had no congratulations or compliments from her and whenever she came up to me it was only to be horrible about someone else. \n\nWhile this is behaviour that sounds like a 14 year old, it really disturbed me as every time I tried to have a good time, she would tear me down and tell me that I was being horrible or bossy to people (I wasn\u2019t). \n\nI really don\u2019t know how to move forward as she doesn\u2019t know how much this upset me and she is getting too old for this behaviour to be acceptable. I wanted one nice moment with my sister on my wedding day and I didn\u2019t have a single one. She is now planning on moving to live in the same city as me so I either have to pretend like it never happened, or call her out, and I don\u2019t want to fall out with her. \n\nI only want the best for her but she can\u2019t treat people this way.

    "selftext": "I never imagined that my life would take such a terrifying turn. It began innocently enough, on a seemingly ordinary day. My sister, Emily, and I shared a close bond, one that had weathered countless storms. But little did I know, a storm of a different kind was about to descend upon us.\n\nIt was a moonlit night, the kind that cast long shadows and whispered secrets. I returned home after a long day, expecting to find Emily there, her warm smile welcoming me. But as I stepped through the front door, an icy shiver ran down my spine. Something was off.\n\nI called out to her, but there was no response. Panic gripped my heart as I searched every room, my voice growing more desperate with each passing moment. Then, I heard it\u2014a faint whisper, barely audible, as if it came from a distant realm. It called my name.\n\nFollowing the ethereal voice, I found myself in Emily's room. The air was heavy, suffused with an eerie stillness. And there, standing in the center of the room, was Emily\u2014or at least, what appeared to be her. Her eyes, once filled with warmth and love, now held a sinister glimmer. Her voice, once so familiar, now echoed with an otherworldly hollowness.\n\nFear and disbelief collided within me, but I refused to accept that this creature before me was truly my sister. I pleaded with her, begged her to snap out of whatever trance had befallen her. But her response was chilling, a cruel mockery of the sister I knew.\n\nThe days turned into nights, and with each passing moment, Emily's transformation became more pronounced. She grew distant, withdrawn, as if the very essence of her being was being drained away. It was clear that something insidious had taken hold of her, something beyond the realm of understanding.\n\nDriven by desperation and a love that refused to yield, I embarked on a perilous journey to uncover the truth. Rumors whispered of a sinister creature that inhabited the depths of the nearby woods\u2014a creature known as the Soulweaver. It was said to have the power to possess and corrupt the souls of its victims, turning them into vessels of darkness.\n\nWith trepidation coursing through my veins, I ventured into the heart of those foreboding woods. The trees loomed like ancient sentinels, their gnarled branches reaching out like skeletal fingers. As I delved deeper into the shadows, the air grew heavy with an oppressive malevolence, as if the very forest itself conspired against my quest.\n\nFinally, I reached a clearing bathed in an eerie glow. A figure emerged from the mist, its form shifting and undulating with an unnatural grace. The Soulweaver stood before me\u2014a grotesque amalgamation of nightmare and despair. Its eyes burned with a sickly light, its voice a haunting chorus of whispers.\n\nI confronted the creature, my heart pounding in my chest. With every fiber of my being, I demanded that it release my sister from its clutches. But the Soulweaver only laughed\u2014a chilling, mirthless sound that seemed to echo through the depths of my soul.\n\nIn that moment, I understood the true horror of my situation. My sister's body was a vessel, a mere puppet controlled by the malevolent force that stood before me. Emily's essence, her very soul, was trapped within an insidious web, Embracing the terror that coursed through my veins, I stepped closer to the Soulweaver, my gaze locked with its sickening, luminescent eyes. Its laugh died down, replaced by an eerily calm whisper. \"You think you can simply demand her back?\" it taunted, the echoes of its voice bouncing off the ancient trees, creating a symphony of dread. \"Her soul is mine.\"\n\n\"No,\" I snarled, defiance burning in my voice. \"You took her from me, and I'm here to take her back.\"\n\nThe creature only laughed again, its form wavering and shifting as if made of smoke and shadow. \"Very well,\" it echoed, its voice a chilling symphony of torment. \"Try to take her soul back, if you dare.\"\n\nI reached out to the creature, my hand shaking as I touched the swirling form of the Soulweaver. A jolt of icy dread shot through me, and my vision was consumed by an abyss of darkness. I was pulled into a nightmarish world, a chilling tableau painted with the darkest shades of despair.\n\nI found myself standing in an endless expanse of shadow, the ground beneath me pulsating with an eerie rhythm. And in the distance, I saw a faint light\u2014a glimmering beacon amidst the darkness. It was Emily.\n\nI ran towards her, my heart pounding in my chest. But as I approached, a horrifying scene unfolded. Emily was trapped within a pulsating web of darkness, her body convulsing as shadowy tendrils coiled around her, drawing the life from her.\n\nHer eyes met mine, filled with a terrifying mixture of fear and resignation. \"It's too late,\" she whispered, her voice echoing with a haunting emptiness. \"I'm already part of it.\"\n\n\"No!\" I cried, reaching for her. But as my hand touched the web, a searing pain shot through me. The web was not just holding Emily\u2014it was feeding on her, drawing on her soul, her essence, her very being. \n\nLooking into Emily's fading eyes, I saw a horrifying reflection of my own fate. I was not just losing my sister; I was about to lose myself. The Soulweaver had not just taken Emily; it was about to claim another victim. And I, in my desperate attempt to save her, had walked right into its trap.\n\nThe world around me began to warp and shift, the darkness closing in. I could feel the shadowy tendrils starting to coil around me, their icy touch a chilling promise of the fate awaiting me. The last thing I remember was Emily's voice fading into the distance, a haunting echo that would forever be etched in my memory.\n\n\"Run... Save... Yourself...\"\n\nBut it was too late. The darkness had claimed me.\n\nAs the shadowy tendrils tightened their grip, I could feel my very self slipping away, consumed by the insatiable hunger of the Soulweaver. Emily was gone, lost to the darkness, and I was about to follow her into the abyss. The last thing I heard was the Soulweaver's chilling laughter, a sound that would echo in the endless expanse of darkness that was now my eternal prison.",

I was gifted a bike for Christmas and fell back in love with it. I live by the beach and treasure every early morning ride I can get. Since January I\u2019ve ridden about 600 miles, I go about once a week for anywhere between 20-50 miles. Usually all along paved beach paths. My current bike is a Schwinn, it\u2019s been great but doesn\u2019t seem to be holding up. A pedal cracked, the tires wobble, the brake pads wander all over the place. What sort of bikes should I be looking at? I\u2019m 6\u20193\u201d and believe I have an XL sized bike, I\u2019m honestly not familiar with sizes either. If I wanted to upgrade for my purposes, what would be worth spending $500-600? Thank you!",

While you can engage in regular exercise and maintain a healthy diet to support muscle growth and overall health, your body's basic structure is largely determined by genetics. \n\n**Height:** Height is also largely determined by genetics, influenced by factors such as parental height and growth patterns. There is no reliable method to significantly increase height once your growth plates have closed, typically around the late teens to early twenties. \n\n**Self-Acceptance:** It's important to focus on self-acceptance and embracing your natural attributes. Physical appearance is just one aspect of who you are as a person. Developing confidence, self-esteem, and a positive self-image are valuable traits that contribute to a fulfilling life. \n\n**Health and Fitness:** Prioritize your overall health and well-being. Engage in regular physical activity, eat a balanced diet, stay hydrated, get adequate sleep, and manage stress.

    "selftext": "Sorry in advance for the overly long explanation and rant ahead. I'm just very disheartened by the way normal people are being treated over a silly little game\n\nSo for those unaware, Fae Farm is an upcoming cozy farm, adventure, light rpg type game. People were initially worried about the price point of the game, $60 across the board. Which was very understandable, I wasn't expecting that either. But then the price dropped on PC from to $40 for base, and $60 which includes the two upcoming DLC. And the Switch version is still only $60, but it will always be the deluxe version. People have speculated that Nintendo won't let them change the price so soon before it releases (September 8th), but who knows for sure.\n\nNow all of that is understandable, with so many games coming out you want to try and pick the right one for you and for your budget.\n\nAfter all of that a YouTuber called Kanzalone made a review of the game, based on the first five hours he's played, and he had a lot of negative things to say. The dialogue was bad, there's no consequences for passing out, you can only sell so many items a day etc. It made a lot of people skeptical of the quality, myself included. Before his video most of the \"first impressions\" type vids were fairly positive.\n\nSince that video people have begun attacking or massively downvoting others who don't mind the issues, and have even dmed some people calling them plants, shills and so on.\n\nThis has even trickled down to other YouTubers who are remaining fairly positive, while still acknowledging the game's shortcomings. I've seen some really mean spirited comments under Josh's Gaming Garden's newest Fae Farm vid, where he mentions how he dislikes the lackluster festivals, and that the vendor npcs aren't characters like the other ones, they can't be befriended etc. But he also says that a lot of other gameplay elements are very good and exactly what he wants. People were calling him a liar, and saying that he's destroying his fan's trust, among other things\n\nSame thing goes for another YouTuber, Eeowna. She's typically pretty positive about games overall, but she always points out things that she doesn't enjoy, and which versions look better and run better (like DDV). And she has been accused of being paid to say nice things, and ignore every problem with the game, etc etc etc.\n\nThis whole thing just really boils my blood. Especially because I thought that the cozy community was supposed to be more chill and lighthearted than other facets of the gaming world. Like I fully understand not liking what we've seen, and wanting to wait for the game to be released, it's just the spamming, rude comments, and questions of intelligence and character, that are taking it way too far.\n\nI mean, I literally shared a 3 hour stream, not a review, of Eeowna playing the game and showing off all of the early game features in the Cozy Gamers subreddit and got downvoted. The stream really helped me decide whether or not to purchase the game, because all of the reviews were so conflicting, especially because everyone has there own tastes, so actually seeing what the gameplay was like in practice made a difference for me. It's one of the reasons I enjoy watching Let's Players and Streamers play my anticipated games, reviews are too hard to gauge for me. So I thought it would help anyone else who was on the fence, those who preordered could cancel if it didn't fit their standards, and those who worried about quality could have their minds eased if it was up to their standards.\n\nAgain sorry for the long post, I just really needed to vent about this, because my mind won't settle otherwise\n\nTLDR: Lots of people, streamers and YouTubers included, are being ridiculed for being mostly positive about Fae Farm",

My partner, (M20s), of 5 years has been upset with me recently for my underwear decisions to school.\n\nI'm definitely more of a androgynous dresser, but as of late have taken up tight pants / long shirt combos. I've started wearing workout (yoga? but more athletic and capri) pants to school as well some days, as I just don't have many pants and I don't care for fashion much beyond funny t-shirts. \n\nGrowing up, it somehow became a given in my mind that when you wear tight pants, you should wear a thong so others cannot see your underwear line. I don't know if it was my mom, or tv, or my friends growing up but-- I thought this was the norm, or at least expected. The sort of thing you read in a \"How To Be A Women TM\" books as a kid. So that's what I do. My underwear ranges from actual boxers to a few cute-ish thongs (still cotton and normal for daily wear, not lingerie), so when I wear jeans I'll do whatever.\n\nMy partner is Not Happy about this. He says, logically, the reason a person would do that is because they want / expext others to look at their butt. So I must do it because I'm thinking about other people looking at my butt at school (mind you, I never wear these pants without an XL T-shirt but... anyway...). Is he correct?

This is Lead Ranger Kor'Os of the Hazeborn.\"\n\n\"Court?\"  Kor'Os asked curiously from where she was writing in her journal.  Despite it still being early morning she was already wearing her leather  armored uniform. \"Is that what you think we've been doing?\" She asked.  \"I just thought we were fucking. I didn't realize you wanted it to go  that far.\"\n\nArtair's shoulders  slumped as he looked at her in the reflection of his mirror, where he  was using a set of snips to keep his beard trimmed.\n\n\"Kor.\" He whined. \"We talked about this. The only reason we were going to the Krag was so I could meet your Clan Father.\"\n\n\"I  thought that was just because you wanted to ask forgiveness for taking  me from my duties.\" She said without looking up from her journal. \"I'm  supposed to be a scout commander.\" She reminded him.\n\nArtair simply stared at her, the little scissors paused mid shear.\n\nBut he saw the little smirk at the corner of her mouth.\n\n\"You're messing with me.\" He said in annoyance.\n\n\"Have  been for about eight months now.\" She said before looking up and  sticking her tongue out at him.  He returned the gesture in kind.\n\n\"Gods why do I like you?\" He asked silently.\n\n\"Because  you have a weird domination thing going on and you've yet to beat me in  a fight?\" She mused. \"Or maybe its because you see in me someone who  actually upholds the code of the Petravian Army to the very heart of  their being. And you wish to be close to them so you can learn what true  responsibility and duty are like.\"\n\n\"Firstly,  that's not even remotely accurate.\" He said as he held the scissors up  and pointed them at her. \"Second, I've beat you twice now.\"\n\n\"Out of fourteen duels.\" She said under her breath. But he ignored it.\n\n\"Third,  If I really wanted someone like that I would just hang out with my army  loving sister and uncle. And in case you haven't noticed, I make a  point of avoiding both the capital AND Jadesport.\" He said as he turned  and went back to his grooming. \"Lastly, that's just rude.\"\n\n\"Leave  your goatee long.\" She said as she saw the scissors move near it out of  the corner of her eye. \"You know I like it longer.\"\n\nWithout  even thinking Artair moved the scissors to the other side of his mouth,  skipping the area she'd mentioned. Then he paused and looked at them as  he realized what had just happened.\n\nKor'Os  lifted the map she'd been comparing her notes to so that it covered the  grin on her face as he tried to look at her in the mirror again.\n\n\\-------------------------------\n\nJames and Amina were both beaming as they stood on the small berm around the construction site.\n\n\"James this is a beautiful site.\" Amina said as she leaned her head against his.\n\n\"Don't  thank me for that.\" He said honestly as he leaned into her. \"Jurl chose  this spot. Or it was just the only chunk of land that could be bought. I  don't actually know how property laws work here.\" He said as he looked  around. \"Do people own this area?\"\n\nAround  them the rain forest near the hot springs was alive with noise and  motion as the animals of the land. And in front of them a large group of  people were moving supplies in and out of the clearing. there was  already a foundation laid down. And some of the workers were using magic  to quickly secure strong wooden beams, that looked as if they'd been  burned somewhat, into the stone before solidifying it.\n\nAnother  one of the workers, wearing gear that looked more like a mages than a  craftsman's, was moving a large bubble of water from the nearby springs  through a series of meshes that filtered out bits of detritus and  sediment. Then they placed the water into something that looked akin to a  diagram James had seen once of a makeshift water filter. That filter  then poured the water into a massive copper basin that was set into the  stone and had a cover over most of it. He assumed it would go on to  become their water tank.\n\nOff to  the sides and behind the building were several massive piles of various  sized boulders and rocks, as well as large containers that appeared to  be filled with sand. James imagined that they would eventually become  the walls that would surround the compound and be infused with  enchantments and runes to keep intruders out.\n\n\"James  how much did all this cost?\" She asked as she looked at the wagon that  was still ambling down the road they'd ridden down toward the  construction site. \"This must have been a lot.\"\n\nHe  nodded. \"It was. But, according to the royal bank I still have plenty  to spare.\" He shrugged a bit. \"Between the elementals, the stipend I get  as the summoned hero, and even coming in as a disqualified third place  in the tournament. I'm... still pretty well off.\"\n\n\"Personally.\"  Jurl said as he walked up behind them with a round case that he was  pulling some rolled parchments out of. \"I think James is being  conservative given the location. And I wholeheartedly approve.\" He said  as he selected one of the rolls and put the others back. A moment later  he was holding the sketch that was on it up so that they could compare  it to the current progress. \"I've never been as big on ostentation as my  partners in the company are. Understated is best.\"\n\n\"Four buildings?\" Amina asked curiously. \"I thought it was only one.\"\n\n\"Eh.  Hindsight and revisions.\" James said. \"In the original plans I forgot  that we needed a spot for Steve.\" He admitted. He was actually a little  ashamed of that fact. \"Then I remembered that you now have a griffin  nearly the same size and that the two of them probably don't wanna be  roommates. So a second one was needed.\" He dipped his head a bit as he  pursed his lips. \"And the last ACTUAL house is for my mom. Or anyone who  wants to visit and stay overnight. Or... whatever.\" He said flippantly.\n\n\"Your  mother's not going to live with us?\" She asked in surprise as Jurl then  moved over near one of the tables and replaced the sketch with some of  his blueprints. He knew this was a couple's conversation and he wasn't  needed for it.\n\n\"I thought about  it.\" James replied. \"But with Veliry almost definitely not leaving the  castle, or at least the capital. And with my mom well on her way to  being one of the castle's lead healers? No way. We'll probably only see  her for weekends and holidays.\"\n\n\"I kind of thought she'd come out here with us.\" Amina said with a slight pout. \"I guess you're right though.\"\n\n\"She'll  probably try.\" James agreed. \"But... give her a month or two with  nothing to do except baby stuff and she'll be pulling her hair out.\"  Then he thought. \"Plus she hates humidity.... and bugs. This place will  drive her wild.\"\n\n\"Mmm. That's probably true.\" Amina agreed. Mrs. Choi had never seemed like the one to sit on her hands for too long.\n\n\"If  you guys would like.\" Jurl said, grabbing their attention. \"There's  some tents and things down near the springs. They're for the crew, but  we always have a few spares set up for the people that don't stay there  full time.\"\n\n\"We did bring bathing  suits.\" James said. \"And my mom does have the twins and the pups for the  rest of the day as long as we get back in time. And Glag's keeping em  safe.\"\n\nAmina did not need to be told twice.\n\nNor did Steve, who quickly followed behind, and eagerly jumped in the water like he had so long ago.\n\n\\------------------\n\nKing Farrick sat in the conference room with a glass of wine and both of his Arch Mages present.\n\nAs soon as the screen turned on with the face of the Colonel he sat up straighter and pushed the glass away.\n\n\"Your majesty.\" She said with a nod. \"The President will be on in just a few seconds.\"\n\nHe  nodded back. He knew from James, Vickers, and the Ambassador, that the  President was a busy man even by world leader standards. It actually  made him somewhat glad that communication in his world was slow compared  to on Earth. He could always tolerate LESS paperwork, and it seemed  that constant information flow was the enemy of that concept.\n\nSure  enough, a few moments later the screen switched over and showed the  president sitting in a plush white chair. It was obvious that he wasn't  in the same location as the Colonel.\n\n\"Your Majesty.\" He said in that smooth voice he had. \"How can I help you today?\" He asked.\n\nThe  translation software on the communication hub had been updated  repeatedly over the past few years, and now the words that came out of  the machine were in fluent Petravian to the King's ears. Though it did  cause a discomforting phenomena that James had referred to as  Bad-Dub-Mouth.\n\n\"Good afternoon Mr.  President.\" King Farrick said. Then he braced himself for what was no  doubt going to be a very long conversation that would never be allowed  to leave either of the rooms they were in. \"I came to tell you about a  little... technological development that my people have been working on  for quite some time now.\"\n\nThe  president sat up straighter in his chair, suddenly aware of the  seriousness of the conversation. Something occurred with the room he was  in and the glass of water on his table slid a bit as he bobbed up and  down for a moment. The king ignored the way the two mages looked at each  other curiously at that.\n\n\"Oh?\" The President said in mild surprise. \"And what's that?\"\n\nFarrick  could see the hunger hidden right behind the calm facade that his rival  was wearing. Were he less experienced in this game he might have shown  discomfort, or perhaps second guessed the plan he had.\n\nBut he knew what he was doing.\n\n\"Well.\"  He began. \"We believe we may have figured out a way to open the path  between our worlds again.\" At that the president was completely upright  in his seat and his eyes were rapt with curiousity.\n\nThen the King lied. \"And we believe we may be at the point where testing it is necessary.\"\n\n\\-------------------------\n\nWhen  Samantha first entered Fletcher's office to watch the news they tried  sitting next to each other behind his desk, pulling one of the chairs  from in front of the desk around so she could sit in it.\n\nBut her legs were too long and she was just a bit too wide for both of them to squeeze in there at the same time.\n\nSo she'd done the bold thing and attempted to sit in his lap, with her arms around his shoulder.\n\nThen  she'd been painfully reminded, mainly by his subtle squirms and grunts  of discomfort, that she was much heavier than she used to be.\n\nSo they'd changed seating one more time.\n\n\"This  feels...... awkward.\" He said as he sat on HER lap instead. On his  computer screen was the main K-Span channel that ran international news  of the non-political variety.\n\n\"Are  you uncomfortable Mr. Fletcher?\" She asked in amusement. \"Is my fur not  soft enough for your, admittedly well sculpted, butt to sit on?\"\n\nHe looked back at her with mock upset on his face.\n\n\"Noooo.\" He said sarcastically. \"It's just... this is backwards and its messing with me.\" He admitted. \"Also thank you.\"\n\n\"For what?\" She asked, amused.\n\n\"The comment about my butt.\" He said with no shame. \"I work hard riding my bike to get it that way.\"\n\n\"Oh god.\" She said with fake horror. \"I'm dating a guy who rides a bike to work.\"\n\n\"I  don't ride it to work.\" He said. \"I just use it for cardio every now  and then. Also squats. Super clutch. Now shut up it's about to restart.\"  He added as he pointed at his screen and settled back against her.\n\nShe chuckled as he squirmed a bit to try to get comfortable.\n\n*\"Good  evening viewers I'm Donny Greenburg with K-Span stream-five news. CRAZY  images coming from Sturgis today as WEREWOLVES were spotted, seemingly  unattended, as they roamed the main street of the city. People have been  posting images and videos of the wolves shopping, eating at one of the  local buffets, interacting with children, and even getting some time in  on a basketball court with some of the townspeople of Sturgis.\"*\n\nAs  the host spoke, images from the day's trip popped up on the screen next  to him. She recognized the images of her in the plus size boutique, an  image of Brighton comparing jerseys with the little boy while Ngoko  scarfed down a slice of pizza behind them, and of course the group photo  from the court.\n\n\"The bit with the  kid was kinda cute if you ignore the mom.\" Fletcher said. The motion of  him turning to look at her put his mouth close to her ear, and his  breath made the little hairs in it tickle a bit.\n\n\"Eh, she was a jerk.\" She agreed. \"But Brighton did good. And honestly, I think he was just being himself.\"\n\n\"Well.\" Fletcher said. \"That's what you were trying to show people.\"\n\n*\"Now the comments and posts about this whole thing have been NON-STOP.\"* Greenburg said. *\"Some  people are upset that the wolves seemed to be left to their own devices  and running amok. But others have countered that at several points  throughout the little field trip several undercover members of the SPD  were seen keeping a sort of loose cordon around them. Though it did get a  little relaxed during the basketball game.\"* A clip of Bishop taking the ball to the hoop played for a few seconds. *\"But I mean, can you blame em?\"*  Greenburg asked\\*. \"Look at that slam dunk. Now sure there have been  some naysayers out there. But as reports and streams and posts have been  flooding in, it's become clear that apparently nobody was hurt during  this event.\"\\* Another clip of the basketball game played, this one  showing Lopez casually slipping past two of the defenders with the  basketball. *\"Except maybe for those guys ankles!\"*\n\n\"Jesus.\" Fletcher said as he watched the basketball footage seemingly for the first time. \"Look at those moves.\"\n\n\"That's Lopez.\" She said. \"I guess he's a bit of an athlete.\"\n\n\"I'll say.\" He replied.\n\n*\"Now  this has, somewhat inevitably, raised the question. Given the speech  given by Samantha Jenkins at the town hall. Given the announcement by  the American and Canadian C.U.N. representatives. Given this little  outing- and be tasteful guys, they are PEOPLE, I'm not gonna call it  walkies like so many of you are calling it.\"*\n\nSamantha looked at Fletcher with an eyebrow raised.\n\n\"What?\" He asked. \"It's not like I called it that.\"\n\n\"People are calling it walkies?\" She asked rhetorically. \"Rude.\"\n\n\"You  guys are KINDA... canines.\" He raised a finger defensively as he saw  her readying to speak. \"You know I say that from a technical standpoint.  He is right though.\" He said as he turned the finger to point at the  screen. \"PEOPLE TOO.\"\n\nShe shook her head in annoyance.\n\n*\"But given the nature of these announcements. These public speeches and addresses by members of our OWN government.\"* Greenburg said as he put one hand in his pocket and used the other hand to gesticulate. *\"Are  the werewolves currently being cared for by the city of Sturgis REALLY a  threat to the town and its people? Or for that matter... any of us?\"*  He put his hand in his other pocket\\*. \"Or are they just people who've  gotten a rough shake of things and are making the most of it? We'll take  a deeper dive into that, as well as talk to a few people who were AT  some of these events. All that right after a word from our sponsors.\"\\*\n\nAnd just like that the video was cut off by an add for a product that could apparently clean anything off of anything.\n\nSamantha  reached around Fletcher and took control to scroll down the webpage and  looked at the comments.

    "selftext": "Greetings. I dual booted my Dell XPS 15 with Linux Ubuntu 20.0.0 LTS. I did it just for the fun of it and did not think I would fall completely in love with Linux Ubuntu. While setting up the dual boot I allocated just 50GB of my 512GB to my Ubuntu partition.\n\nA handful of months since then, I have fallen in love with the lightness and simplicity of the Ubuntu OS (or Kernel), it has now become my working partition.  Expectedly, I have maxed out the allocated disk space and would like to allocate up to 200GB more - since I have 300GB free. I keep deleting logs every other day to free some space, because I don't want to go through \"reinstalling\" Ubuntu with the risk of messing things up irredeemably just to resize my disk space.\n\nRecently, while using my Ubuntu partition, I came across a pre-installed program with the name \"Disks\" - I guess it came with the version upgrade to the latest LTS. I opened it to check what it has to offer and I can see all partitions on my drive and also an option to RESIZE my partition.\n\nNow I have questions: \n\nWill it work? Is this option safe? What are the risks involved? Can anyone point me to any guide on how to use this program to resize my partition safely?\n\nTLDR: Can \"Disks\" application/program on Ubuntu be used to resize my Ubuntu partition on my drive? If yes, how can I do it safely?",

It\u2019s not rare to see them wearing a balaclava.  \n4. The bikes they use seems to be one that has very thick tyres.  \nForgive me but these are just observations. It\u2019s not common here for people to wear tracksuits casually, that\u2019s more of an outfit someone would wear on the weekend lazing about or going to the gym.  \nI just have to wonder if a black British person grows up in the same community as a white British person why is their attitudes and social norms so different.

It was not God who commanded for the Bible to be separated between \"Old\" and \"New.\" That was man. So, if the Bible was not separated and actually had all the books (referring to the books that were voted to not be in the Bible) in it, would we read it differently instead of referring to what is Old and what is New? Would we receive it as the entire Word of God?\n\nI ask this because many times I hear people refer to the New Testament and want nothing to do with the Old Testament. But people are eager to sing a Christian song about 'blessings.'  The blessings that actually were connected to the people of Israel. Not to say that we are not born again. Not to say that we are not engrafted in. But it is to say that we cannot have the new without the old. They are connected. And if we separate it, then how can we justify taking a few things from the Old and ignoring the rest of it that applies?  Just a thought.\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not referring to the sacrifices or the ceremonies that were done in the OT. Of course, we know that it is not relevant because there is no Temple standing, which is one of the reasons why it is not done. And also, Jesus is the ultimate sacrifice.*",

Well, almost immediately upon entering college, I flipturned everything, met an amazing woman, and built a life to really be proud of since then- over the course of the last decade+. Now, I\u2019m fully into my adult life, married to that same goddess, and all of that trauma is left behind, my life is pretty tame. Dont get me wrong, I -love- my tame life. Having all of the bullshit in the rearview mirror is a great way to stay appreciative of the little things.\n\nLast night, the wife and I went to a concert. It was nostalgic in all the right ways. Small venue, great atmosphere, and reminded me of the not-so-bad parts of my childhood, like moshing at some shitty local metal band\u2019s concert in the middle of the week, blowing my eardrums out, drinking too much, and smoking too much. I was vibing with the nostalgia, and decided to jump into a death roll in the pit. Was a blast, but I broke a bone. Didnt know it at the time and finished the concert out, went home, got stoned with the wife, then had sex. Woke up this morning with the pain and decided to go to the doctor, who told me it was likely a break. I wont go into the boring medical stuff that followed, but I\u2019m honestly feeling pretty chuffed about the whole thing.\n\nIf I had told my teenage self that I broke a bone at a concert, then got stoned and had sex with the world\u2019s most beautiful woman instead of going to the doctor, young self would be very proud. For all his flaws, he was just a kid trying his best in a real awful situation, and last night I think I did the fucked up little bugger proud.

I have all of this in email.\n\nShe told me yesterday that she was wrong about the policy, they don\u2019t pay 50% for the second six weeks, and I also cannot NOT use vacation to cover them. So, they had a meeting and decided that I owe them $5,100 back pay for the overpayment and that they are taking 104 hours of vacation time from my bank to \u2018settle\u2019. The $5,100 is to be taken from my future paychecks over five pay periods. \n\nShe said multiple times (and in email) that it was their mistake and that she communicated this to me incorrectly. Do I have any recourse here? I am honestly fine to pay back money that I am not supposed to have, though I wish they had let me weigh in on how it\u2019s paid back. But I\u2019m mostly pissed that I am now losing so much vacation. I could have made different decisions about my leave if I had known this information. Now I have no choice and it is being taken. \n\nI kind of feel like I\u2019m being screwed for their mistake. She also kept saying \u2018no one here ever takes maternity leave\u2019 because we work with all men. But that seems like not my problem. \n\nThanks in advance!",

Like inseparable. One thing led to another and he moved in with me. We started a business together and I fell hopelessly in love but I could never tell him, fast forward he ended up going to jail for some old BS and spent a month in there the whole time he was in I held him down and he saw it. He ended up confessing his love for me, told me he wants us to be together and couldn\u2019t wait to be home. He finally got out and I picked him up and it was a whole thing ! W we\u2019re happy. But then the following days changed, he just stopped talking to be like fully, he would even look at me for weeks ! I cried everyday until one day we just picked back up as best friends, the relationship never got brought up ever ! Here we are living like buddy\u2019s or pals but sex is there but then he sleeps in the other room. He won\u2019t go out with other girls and we both don\u2019t talk to anyone, well until recently. I started talking to someone about 6 months ago but only were close friends due to the guy staying with me always acts so angry if someone even flirts with me but then again calls me his \u201chome girl\u201d but at this point now we are walking through the house as though neither one of us exist. All the things we used to do together just randomly stopped. Now when I pick him up from work he puts his head phones in and ignores me like no other every time I speak to him he acts like he could throw up listening to me. I don\u2019t know what to do I feel like I welcomed in my own home ! I miss who we were but my body crazes love!

Our application has been handed back to lettings immediately\u2026 We have been given the option to withdraw our application and become homeless, wait until the repairs are complete (advised could take weeks or months) or they can source alternative accommodation. \n\nLetting agency ignoring requests to provide evidence of leak that has affected 10+ units, claims it will go through developers insurance and there is no ETA of completion (the building was completed a few weeks ago, contractors are still on-site, surely it would come under a defect warranty?). Marketing today on social media from the agency advertising the building is all ready & good to go. \n\nWe are happy to take the alternative option, however it is in the same building. Same no. of bedrooms, same no. of bathrooms and same size. They are almost charging an additional \u00a3300 per month for this switch and advised it would be a permanent switch. What was \u00a31600PCM is now \u00a31900PCM, out of our budget and what was originally agreed between both parties. \n\nCan they increase the rent on alternative accommodation? Could they potentially be lying about the damaged? They claim the price is non-negotiable. Lots of inconsistencies throughout phone calls, timeline of damages occurring not matching up between each contact with agency and giving us minimal option. \n\nWe move in 6 days, everything arranged, rent now increased due to damages.

    "selftext": "So 4 paragraphs out of the 7 I made got deleted and I\u2019m too lazy to rewrite it so:\n\nChapter 1. I met a girl online on discord and became co workers for an art project, I became interested on what was up with her but I remained silent and moved on with my life\n\nChapter 2. About a year passed and this curiosity feeling was killing me so I decided to say hi to her outside of the project room\n\nChapter 3. Project failed and I looked for any reason to talk to her so I did and that escalated into us being good friends\n\nChapter 3.5\n\nWe started doing a lot of things together from watching movies to working on videos together until one day that someone \u201cexposed\u201d me about something I said and it causes a chain reaction and all of that ended and we never talked. (This person is now a good friend and helped me revert to Islam)\n\nChapter 4. days passed, weeks passed, months passed. 7 months after this, March 16-September ?, she sent me a message. I didn\u2019t want to open it because I haven\u2019t seen, heard or talked to her in 7 months but eventually after a few weeks I opened the message. I thought it would of been something like \u201ci hate you, you sick fuck go . Yourself\u201d like someone else did. But no, instead it was her apologizing. Eitherway I didn\u2019t answer because it didn\u2019t feel right to do so. And so October and November passed. 9 months after I stopped talking to her. I decided that it was time and I sent her a message in November 1 2022. And she replied on November 2 2022 and we had a conversation in November 3, I tried my hardest to try to make up for it or try to make things be like they were before and she didn\u2019t seem against it, I asked her about what had happened and she apologized. And so we got close again and one night on mid November. It was a very unique night for me. But what had happened during that night was me trying to confess to her how I felt about her, but I backed out last minute and she said it herself, and I followed up. Sometime around late November I heard her voice for the first time in 9 months and she also got me to talk to someone I was in a bit of an argument with. It was all going well until sometime in December that she stopped replying to my messages. And one night she said some things that still sadden me to this day, she won\u2019t tell me what happened but in the end she blocked me with no explanation asking me to forget about her in every way. And so it ended\n\nChapter 5, December passed, January passed and then February came around. I hadn\u2019t forgotten about her and I spent some nights still thinking about her. But there really was nothing I could do. And that\u2019s when I decided to check my phone for some thing I don\u2019t know, and I saw she had sent me a request and I didn\u2019t know what to do so I looked around my room and saw most of my things on the left side of my room so I accepted, she didn\u2019t explain what happened but just apologized and asked what was going to happen now, while I walked outside under the night. And we decided to be friends again or lovers or whatever, and sure she tried and I tried and there were some good moments of insecurities and such but after like not even 2 months in march sometime she decided that she doesn\u2019t really see it working out and I had to understand that so I wrote her my \u201cfinal message\u201d and so she did claiming that we will meet again, since she is 2 years younger then me she still can be a little silly sometimes. So a way she made up to talk to me but not really talking to me was to pretend to be someone I would call \u201cbritish lady\u201d so she wouldn\u2019t embarrass herself if that makes sense, so in late April she pretended to be her and messaged me telling how \u201cviolet was doing and feeling\u201d, \u201cshe\u201d told me she wanted things to be like before. And I decided to actually talk to her even though I had already been and then I was like nvm and left and came back again until sometime In mid June that my friends told me that it had been enough already, it was getting abused all this leaving and staying since it was getting repetitive\n\nChapter 6. I met another girl that somehow made me move on from her and I wrote her a letter and it all ended yay \ud83c\udf89 \n\nI\u2019m not happy. I love her so much I can not explain it it\u2019s too much for me. I know it was best to leave permanently because she likes someone else and it was all just stupid ig but I will say that I miss it everything from the past and idk it\u2019s too much for me and it pissed me off that 4 damn chapters or 5 I forgot got deleted that were as longthe other ones and would of added more emotion and explanation but eitherway the point is i rlly want to finish the series we started but i cant without her so should i message her?, emqil her? sent her an actual physical mail or",

    "selftext": "I got lip filler and Botox for the first time a week ago. I have always had one side of my upper lip look thinner and I was told after putting in lip filler that she actually believe it\u2019s my muscle doing it. She said although I don\u2019t have a gummy smile we could do something similar that would help relax the one side. So she put one unit in the area around my lip on the opposite side of where the issue was (Side of stache area) well now the side that use to be thin is standing tall and the other side ( the side where the Botox went in) is now droopy and my husband said it looks like I\u2019m having a stroke\u2026. I contacted them today and their advice is well let\u2019s try injecting the other side with .5-1 unit and see if it helps it\u2026.. well I am now terrified they will mess it up more and I guess I\u2019m just here wondering how long one unit will last and is there any advice on what I should do or if there is a way to make Botox go away quicker.\n\n\nPic for reference and yes my lips are still super dried out from the strongest smelling alcohol they wiped them clean with.",

Even when I work them out to get them stronger, they tense and become even more tight. I\u2019ve had Physio, chiro, massage and more done on them and everyone just says stretch and strengthen them. \n\nToday I was about to go for a job and I was warming up my doing single leg RDL\u2019s with a 25lbs kettlebell. I did some other stretches and then proceeded to do a standing tree pose where I placed my right foot over my left knee whilst standing and then going into a squat to get a stretch in. While doing so I felt my knee pop so loud and the sensation of it was so intense. \n\nI immediately sat down thinking I hurt my knee but to my surprise my knee was fine but my hamstring tightness on my right leg was gone. I have no idea how this is correlated and I was hoping to gain some insight. I\u2019ve never had knee tightness or any issues with my knee so I\u2019m surprised that popping or ?realignment? resulted in instant tightness relief. \n\nI tried doing the same process on my left leg which is also tight but nothing happened. \n\nSo does anyone know how the knee popping is correlated to chronic hamstring tightness. I\u2019m surprised no therapist caught it. \n\nAnd does anyone know how to actively release it so I can do my left leg as well? \n\nThanks!",

When I booked Costa Rica I was planning on a fun trip for able bodied people - ziplining, horse back riding, rainforest tours, etc. The plan was not for everyone to be together at all times, but for everyone to have days/ activities they could do over the course of the vacation.However, my body has been having a hard time working correctly lately  (no diagnosis yet but think MS) and suddenly a lot of things seem much harder. I\u2019ll probably need a cane to get around and long distance walks (especially if they are uphill) are probably a no go.\n\nOur trip is 2 days in San Jose and 5 in Puerto Viejo de Talamanca (Lim\u00f3n  Province).

The phone has logical corruption, not physical issues  and cannot be resolved  by swapping parts. We will either crack the encryption or fail the  project\u2026we typically succeed in cracking it.

After finally acquiring the raw data from the NAND, it was discovered that the raw data  is hardware encrypted via the phone\u2019s CPU. We tried various techniques  to decrypt the volume  with no success. Further attempts would be futile at this point.`\n\nIt's been more than a year, but I still need the data.

My world is the same every dream, the streets, stores, buildings, towns, canals, schools, rivers, ponds, airports, everything ever.

I can have a safe, normal dream in the same school I had a violent mass murder dream, and I\u2019ll remember what happened in which stairwell, and i\u2019ll remember it in my dream by thinking \u201coh that\u2019s thAt stairwell\u201d even though it happened in my dream months or years prior. Every single one is in the same world. I hate it because it makes me delusional, it makes me think I need to take extremely drastic measures to get to my dream land.

Is it just something they pretend to do in promotional material, or do they actually care?\n\nDo you feel that the figures on campus have actually helped you? Have you actually had any meaningful interaction with Steve Wozniak, Marc Randolph, etc?\n\nDo HPU students actually get internships? About what percentage? Are these impressive internships? They talk a lot about internships in the promotional material, but don't actually include a statistic like X% of students get 1 internship during their HPU experience.\n\nHow is the caliber of students? Are people ambitious? Do people actually care about engineering, business, management, etc? Are people just in this university for an easy ride?\n\nWill I get a full scholarship? Will I get a stipend? I have a 100.3 WGPA and 1550 SAT, so I know I am a competitive applicant to this university. \n\nMost importantly\n\nDo you think I should go here? Is it worth it? I'm really looking to learn as much as possible out of university.\n\nLet me know what you think :)",

Currently I am 23, resigned from my job a month ago and have been living at home ever since I quit college in 2021. I was one year away from being a radiologist technician but I let the pressure of anxiety get in my head. I\u2019ve always been an extreme over thinker to the point where I am always  in flight or flight mode. I\u2019ve been pretty depressed lately and lack a lot of motivation. My motivation has started to get better, and I\u2019ve been working out and been walking but my social interactions become fewer and fewer each given week. I am scared shitless being around people I don\u2019t know and being in close proximity with them. I get really self conscious in most if not all social situations. I\u2019ve been this way for a while but it has gotten a lot worse as of late because I am isolating. This inpatient program is a huge step because I would be away from home for 2 months without any phone or electronics. I would be staying with 5 different guys my age. I am just so overwhelmed with the thought of losing my phone and making this jump. Any thoughts/advice would be greatly appreciated.",

When the collection was small, in the event of having to GTFO, one/two boxes were easy to grab.  Now that the collection has grown, I've been revisiting this thought.  If I have to GTFO, but can only grab one/two boxes, they need to be the best of what I got...but this concept peaks my anxiety:  What if I get robbed and they grab those one/two boxes?  Then everything is gone and your left with parts of your collection without context.\n\nWhats your play for this?  I had the thought of grouping keys at a certain value/importance into the same box.  Then, placing a board with the name/# of the issue where it would reside in the run.  Any guidance and ideas are appreciated!",

Also sorry for the bad English, it\u2019s not my native language.\n\nMy boyfriend (21/M) cheated on me (22/F) last year. Then he knelt and begged for me to forgive him. He even licked the snot out of my nose when I was crying. I gave him such a hard time but I feel like I\u2019d be so alone if I wasn\u2019t dating him.\n\nIn the med school we\u2019re attending, up until last year, we were a class of 250 people getting classes in a big lecture theatre. I had a small but very intimate group of friends back then. Then the whole class were divided into little groups and I ended up in a group with my now boyfriend, his awful friends, my abusive ex boyfriend and his group of friends. I got separated from all my friends, we got really busy with exams and classes, started seeing them less. I had nobody else to talk to except my boyfriend. I started feeling very lonely at school.\n\nThat\u2019s when he decided to cheat on me, and then BEGGED for me to stay with him. We\u2019re still together but I hardly put any effort. I am so afraid of being alone at school. If we break up, I have to hear him laugh with his friends all day, or face my ex boyfriend who will pity me. I will have nobody to eat with at lunch, nobody to ask for help for classes. All my friends are his friends now, and I hate them. I hate every minute I have to endure them.\n\nThe loneliness only affects me during the school hours but it\u2019s more than half of the daytime nowadays. I have an amazing roommate that listens to me, consoles me and cheers me up. But I don\u2019t see her during the day.\n\nNext year, we will become interns so the school administration will create random groups again, so there are even number of girls and boys in every group. Then I will leave him. But I can\u2019t take the loneliness right now. It would eat me alive.",

    "selftext": "Hi! I've had the idea on mind for quite some time of making myself a Halloween costume based on a D&D character of mine (Ranger, young, long hair, etc.). The thing is, I'm Iberic, and I want to give my character Iberian details (a sling around the waist, a esparto grass braided headband/belt, etc), but, I also wanted to add some practicality to itself. I'm going as a Ranger, after all! \n\nSo, I decided to make myself one of the handiest (in my humble oppinion, of course) cloaks that are out there: the Ruana cloak. It's of celtic origin, yes, but I don't really care if it resonates greatly with the overall theme.\n\nThe situation is this: I've bought two brown blankets of 1,25x1,50 cm, I am 175 cm tall (5'7\") and I have an idea; is it possible to make a Ruana cloak that covers me decently (around the knees preferably, or around the thigh as a minimum) using only one cloak, and not sewing the two blankets together to met a minimum requirement? \n\nI felt that if I sew them to increase the length It'd be enormous... Plus I had the idea of either make another cloak for my best friend with the other blanket, or sew the two together to make a cozier blanket.\n\nThanks!",

The plan was to put the video and the external audio into iMovie, sync up the audio to the video using the Camera Audio for a reference, then mute the Camera Audio and be done with it. But for some reason, when I synced up the sound waves of the two audios in the beginning, if I scrolled multiple minutes through the video, all of a sudden, the audio would be out of sync. It would gradually get more and more out of sync as the video went along. It was as if even though the audios were the same length, somehow the audio took up less space or something.

Its been a month and i tried to understand her pov, try and check how shes doing make sure shes ok, and its like im talking to a different person. None of the sincerity she had while we were together in her texts and makin me feel like she doesnt even read what i say. Half a year ago on our anniversary she wrote that we were soulmates. That i was stuck w her forever. Why did she have to lie like that? Why did she make me feel so loved just to take it all back so fast? I regret caring for her. I regret trying to check on her well being. The two attempts i made to check up on her only makes me feel worse and further shows me she doesnt want anything to do with me. I know half a year down the line im still gonna love her. It just sucks man\u2026. Whyd she have to give me hope and say it may not be over? \n\nSorry guys i dont need advice i just needed to rant and let it all out, i know things get better and time heals all wounds",

    "selftext": "Hello there! I\u2019m back after some time with a new RP idea I\u2019d like to hear back on from people interested. It\u2019s a Fallout NV RP that focuses on my character, one I\u2019ve made up of course, and yours in the aftermath of an NCR Hoover Dam victory. I\u2019ll lay some groundwork below.\n\n*I can play a trans man character if needed or preferred.*\n\n____________\n \nNot long after the battle had settled, word made its way across the Mojave. From Goodsprings to New Vegas itself cheers rung out from everyone from all walks of life to celebrate the destruction of the Legion. Even those that didn\u2019t support the ideals and corruption surrounding the NCR sung praise at the defeat of the deserts obvious enemy.\n\nRumor on the strip was Mr. House had gone into hiding or even worse. With New Vegas now open for control the NCR took it as an opportunity to expand permanently into the Mojave. Soon their military bases all combined efforts, Crimson Caravan set up permanent trails back to the capital, and New Vegas grew ever so quickly. \n\nJust as Shady Sands grew so did New Vegas as thousands migrated to the new area in hopes of making new lives in the wake of a stagnating NCR to the far west coast. One young man named Adam Powers made his way to New Vegas with the help of a small caravan company.\n\nAdam came from very little and lived on the outskirts of NCR control for much of his youth. Soon enough they found themselves engulfed in NCR control as they continued to expand ever more into the Mojave. His mother and father tended to a small personal farm in the irradiated wasteland to which they traded with passing caravans. However, the new road system instilled by the NCR threw a wrench into this leaving the family destitute. \n\nAt 18 Adam left his family home to the Mojave in hopes to find new opportunities. He found New Vegas was no longer a small light in the distance but a now flourishing city almost alien to him. Ignoring it\u2019s destroyed outer edge the city had grown massive. He wasn\u2019t sure where to begin if even at all. Word had it Freeside was a good place to start but it was dangerous. Perhaps Adam could look elsewhere for support to gain access to New Vegas and find fortune there.\n\n_____________\n\nSorry for the long description! I got a bit carried away. Regardless this is what I have for a story so far. Adam is lightly tanned and toned from his life in the hot desert working the land as best he could. His hair is long and past his shoulders but his face is smooth and a bit sharp. While toned he\u2019s mostly skinny and up until now usually wore little clothing besides overalls and the basics. He\u2019s tall as well or can be short depending on preference I don\u2019t mind. Sexually speaking he\u2019s very inexperienced but has found an interest in men during his travels. He keeps himself as shaven as possible but arrives a bit hairy due to not having real running water at his home.\n\nHe\u2019s a little unsure of new age common curtesy. This is because of his lonely desert upbringing and not being used to being around others. He has little physically boundaries, opening his overalls to take a leak anywhere for example. He also eats a bit loud and perhaps louder with better food than he\u2019s used to. Many things are new to him. \n\nOnto your character it can be literally anything you want. Preferably to start your character can be a guide to mine or sorts, helping my get a grasp on things and how they work in New Vegas and befriend each other along the way. Besides that we can do anything! Perhaps we devise a plan to break into the Lucky 38 to find out the true secret to Mr. House\u2019s disappearance or find his riches. Maybe we gamble our troubles away or start a business of some kind. I\u2019m open for exciting story ideas or just slice of life fun. Another idea I had too was my character starting a job as a caravan helper and meeting yours during our travels, anything! You can also play as anything or anyone, furry characters are welcome! Maybe a smart deathclaw or something like that.\n\nIf you read this far include the comment \u201cStrawberry\u201d in your first message to me!\n\nKinks: Exhibition, public, minimal clothing, size difference (pp and body size), degradation, dom/sub dynamics, mating press, breeding, rimming (giving and getting), mpreg, omegaverse (not needed but something interesting), possibly cucking?\n\nLimits: Cross dressing, scat, musk, feet, femboys, pain, and RP in first person!\n\nI\u2019m open to playing or playing with a trans guy as well! If interested just ask and we can fit that into the story. I\u2019m looking for something long term and perhaps on Discord. I\u2019m very detailed in my messages mostly but I\u2019ll match you. Just try to be detailed and only RP in 3rd person!",

In light of that I share the following:\n3 weeks ago I attended the wedding where the bride recently joined the church and went through the temple for the very first time just that day. Her husband told me afterward that she was so worried about wearing at the reception the sleeveless low-cut (lots of cleavage) wedding dress that her mother hand sewed for her over a year earlier... before she joined the church and learned about temple garments. The husband told me that she took the temple lessons with our former stake president and his wife, during which time she expressed her uncertainty about wearing the dress, knowing it would not accommodate garments. She asked their advice. The former stake president and his wife told her they could not make that decision for her... it was between her and the Lord. With much trepidation, she decided to wear the dress her mom worked so hard to make for her. The husband shared that at the reception she went to say hello to the former stake president and his wife... when she gave him a hug he literally said to her,\"I'm so glad to see that you decided to wear the dress. I couldn't make the decision for you, but I am happy to see you decided to honor your mother's hard work this way. You look beautiful!\" The husband said that all her fears and uncertainty melted with that statement and she had an amazing time at her reception. \nSo I ask, who showed the pure light and love of Christ? The former stake president who saw the true beauty of a blushing bride and did NOT judge her for wearing a sleeveless low-cut wedding dress? Or the person who looked with disgust at a woman wearing tight leggings and wondered if she was wearing garments?\nWhen the woman was caught in adultery and brought to Christ for him to judge, He did not judge her. And He discouraged others from judging as well.",

    "selftext": "Hello! \n\nLooking for some advice - I\u2019m a PR in Canada and have been renting. Recently, my work went remote and I moved out of the city into my parents holiday property and have been living here. It\u2019s out in the country and I enjoy it. It\u2019s been in the family a little while but they live in Australia full time. \n\nMy parents are older and have said they\u2019d like to gift me the property. Due to the cost of rent, I don\u2019t have a huge amount of savings apart from my pension - but I\u2019ve been saving more. However the property could do with a little updating. If I was to make it my home, I\u2019d like to put some money into it. \n\nFirstly, are they able to gift me the property? They aren\u2019t tax residents of Canada and it\u2019s never been rented. \n\nSecondly, would I be able to then get some money out of the equity to do some renovations? As I\u2019m not paying rent, I have more disposable income. \n\nI\u2019ve heard of a HELOC but wondering if I\u2019d be eligible. I have a small amount of debt on cards that is low interest, I\u2019m nearly done paying this but no other outgoing costs. \n\nI\u2019d rather not sell the place as it has history and given the house prices nowadays, I\u2019d rather stay put. There\u2019s no chance of my job not being remote. \n\nThank you!",

    "selftext": "I read some things about vaginas online that turned me off men and made me wonder why it doesn't turn other women off men, make them feel desexualised nor depress them, and why they would want to find exceptions when the bigger picture on a larger scale, is negative. The bare minimum you'd expect sexually of men as a gender is that they'd value vaginas. I became reclusive due to thinking that these things are casually believed and accepted\n\nI asked my parents, sister and psychologist about it, and they said:\n\nI read that men sexualise and fetishize women who have penises, but women and gay men don't do that with men who have vaginas. Proving penises are more liked than vaginas. My parents, sister and psychologist said that the vast majority of men have no interest in transgender women pre op nor post op and have no interest in women who have penises \n\nI read that oral is given far more to men than to women and that this isn't about male selfishness, since gay men are male and give the most oral of all. So the reason must be that vaginas are less appreciated. My parents, sister and psychologist told me that oral is 50/50 between men and women\n\nI read that vaginas are seen as gross, taboo and have stigma and that gay men are more openly disgusted by them than lesbians are by penises. My parents, sister and psychologist said they are definitely not seen in that way and that gay men are not more disgusted than lesbians\n\nI read that femdom is seen to be mostly about penis imitation in the form of strap ons and pegging and that those things are not seen as merely toys in a similar shape, but seen as replicas of penises. My parents, sister and psychologist said none of this is true\n\nI read that sex is seen to be defined by and all about penis/the most vital part. So lesbians have their sex validity questioned, whereas gay men do not. And I read that bisexuals are believed to prefer penises. My parents, sister and psychologist said that these things are not true\n\nI read that men are more attracted to a performance or costume of femininity rather than to actual women. So feminized men and penises are less of a turn off than an overweight woman or an unshaven woman who is showing her natural body hair. Whereas women and gay men are attracted to men, not merely masculinity. So androgynous men have always been heartthrobs and women and gay men would not find a masculine woman a turn on and would find vaginas more of a turn off than any type of man. My parents, sister and psychologist said men would rather any type of woman than a feminine man\n\nI read that vaginas are not appreciated as much as big penises, boobs and butts are. And that vaginas are seen as merely means to an end holes, while men love their own penises more. My parents, sister and psychologist said they are appreciated just as much as the others\n\nWhat do you think?",

    "selftext": "I have not been in a single relationship. Short term or long term. And while I understand that a relationship should not be my only source of happiness, not being in one feels like the main source of unhappiness in my life. To the point where it overshadows other sources of joy.\n\nIt\u2019s not that I want just sex or romance or anything like that, although I do also want those as well. Honestly, I think I just really want to be intimate with someone. Anyone. Someone who I can hold hands with and hug or kiss and find comfort in without feeling awkward or uncomfortable. Someone who I can be completely open with my thoughts and feelings and won\u2019t judge me or think I\u2019m weird. Someone who cares for me on a deeper level than anyone else. Where I feel wanted and needed without being a burden.\n\nI make jokes with my friends about how I\u2019m bitchless, I\u2019m a gamer incel, I haven\u2019t felt the touch of a woman etc., which I find funny and laugh at as well even at my own expense, but there are moments where it genuinely does make me sad because it\u2019s basically true.\n\nI\u2019m not desperate to have one but I also hate the idea of waiting. Which just makes me sound desperate because of how often I can\u2019t help but bring it up (probably as a cry for help now that I think about it). Everyone says one day the right person will just kind of appear, but it hurts thinking how long that will take. How many years will I spend alone before that finally happens? I have friends, yes, and I love them and love spending time with them, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong to crave a deeper connection with one person.\n\nIt feels dumb, because I have so many friends who I see quite often and do stuff all the time with, yet I still feel lonely. Like a piece of me is missing.\n\nAll my other single friends seem to easily be able talk to multiple people and be in and out of relationships. They tell me you just have to act confident and love yourself and that will naturally make you more attractive in general. \n\nI am confident in myself. I have good hygiene, take pride in my interests, have fairly average facial features and I am in decent shape. I\u2019d like to think I\u2019m confident in how I present myself to others in general. But there are still moments where I don\u2019t feel attractive. Where my brain tells me that the reason I haven\u2019t got in a relationship is because I\u2019m not attractive, especially towards the type of women I\u2019m attracted to.\n\nI also can\u2019t help but think that I\u2019m doing something wrong that\u2019s causing me to be unattractive or is the reason why i end up in so many talking stages where I feel like I\u2019m the only one showing interest.\n\nI won\u2019t deny that I do have a fairly specific type that I\u2019m attracted to, but that is only an ideal not an expectation. I\u2019d like to think I\u2019m not super picky and that I\u2019m allowed to have a bit of preference. And I\u2019m not willing to lower my standards just for the sake of \u201cgetting some pussy\u201d. \n\nMaybe my standards are too idealistic/unrealistic, but I don\u2019t go out often enough to meet new people all the time and even then I have yet to come across anyone who I\u2019ve found attractive enough to have the confidence to actually talk to. Mostly due to overthinking, but also because I find people infinitely more attractive once I get to know them.\n\nEvery time I do try and get close to someone I\u2019m interested in, they aren\u2019t interested in me, or get with someone else, or just don\u2019t seem to have the desire to get closer and get to know each other like I do. Like I say, I feel like I am doing something wrong.\n\nIt\u2019s not fair. It sounds childish and whiny I know, but it\u2019s how I feel, and I\u2019m sick of feeling like I\u2019m wrong or stupid for feeling this way. I just don\u2019t know what to with these feelings.\n\nI know this is long, but I don\u2019t really care if people see this or not. I just needed to get it out of my system.",

I'll never have a job or buy my own house or amount to anything! I want to kill myself before i turn 30 years old still in my parents house. I have to do it. I won't allow myself to cross that age being a burden. I refuse to allow it",

    "selftext": "I'm sorry in advance that this is so long. It's my first post. The original draft got deleted so I tried to scrounge up whatever I could remember. I'm also sure my partner will see this... but I just need some advice from outside sources right now. \n\nSo, a bit of backstory here. My mother has been in an extremely toxic and mentally abusive relationship for ~7 years now. Her husband managed to convince her to marry him by pulling the \"sweet\" act. He was offering all of these nice things, taking accountability for what he'd done/apologizing, saying he would go to therapy... the whole nine yards of things you would want to see in a partner that wasn't always the greatest. Well, once they were married, that act continued for maybe 2 more weeks before he went back to his same manipulative and narcissistic behavior. \n\nMy mother finally realized after the couple months of them being married that it was an act, he never meant any of what he said, and that he wasn't going to change. So, she calls crying. Ugh, no. She was sobbing. Saying she doesn't know what to do anymore. Asking what she did so wrong to deserve a life like this? My mother, who has always been an extremely strong, independent, and fierce woman in my eyes was suddenly doubting every aspect of herself. Feeling like she was the lowest of the low. Wanting to end it all because \"how could it get better for her when she's already 47?\"\n\nI know full well that I should have talked it over with my partner first, but I just immediately offered for her to come live with us. I completely understand that it was not a decision to be made on my own, but... hearing her the way she was and that she'd been having suicidal thoughts? I wasn't thinking straight. I just knew I wanted her out of that situation. \n\nMy mom has always been such a kind hearted person. Kind to a fault. She is 100% a people pleaser. She's only ever wanted the people around her to be happy. She was the \"mom\" to so many of my friends growing up because all she ever wanted to do was help. She's the most accepting and open minded person I've met. She's hard working and so strong willed. Sure, my childhood wasn't the absolute best, with her raising me as a single mother, but she tried SO hard. I have so many amazing memories that far outweigh any bad ones. Seeing someone like her become so... defeated just broke my heart completely.\n\nWe currently live in a 2 bed 2 bath farm house. The other room is just being used to keep our reptiles/gaming setups which we already had plans on downsizing for more space or moving around anyway. All in all, we have the space, we'd just need to move some stuff around and reorganize a bit.\n\nAs for my partner and I, we just cannot come to an agreement on this. It's causing a fight/argument of some sort every time we talk. At first, she was going to stay with us permanently. My partner expressed his discomfort with that, saying that it would be different if it was short term. So, I tried to come up with a compromise. Instead of a permanent stay, she would only stay for about a year so that she could work on her credit and get her own place. Apparently that is still an issue, but I really don't want to compromise further since she can't get her own place right now with her credit being where it's at. His primary concern is her having to leave her job and come to our state without one, thinking that we would be supporting her financially. I do understand that concern, but that is also why she will have a 1 month deadline to find a job, and one that I'll be helping her look for as well. He also just keeps reiterating that it's not right for a mom to be so codependent on her child. \n\nI know this whole thing isn't ideal, and that the timing is terrible since we haven't been in the absolute best situation financially ourselves. I really do get that. But what other kinds of compromises can I throw out there at this point? \n\nWe're at an impasse that truly hurts me. I didn't think that this would ever be the sort of issue that it is. I guess that I assumed that he would have the same mindset I would if the roles were reversed. If it were his mother or father needing help, and wanting to stay with us permanently, I'd be fine with it. Life sucks and stuff happens. But obviously that isn't the case and it truly breaks my heart. I love and adore my partner so, so much. I truly believed in the future we have talked about and planned. We just got our ring sizes the other day because we had been discussing getting engaged. Now... I don't know. This whole issue is really making me second guess the entirety of our relationship, and that hurts even more. After everything else we had been through together (which has truly been some unimaginably messed up stuff), I really didn't think that helping my mother out would be the tipping point for us. I'm lost myself right now on what to do anymore.\n\nSorry this is so long, and I really don't know what to say for a TLDR, so for anyone that took the time to read this and has any advice... I would appreciate it so much.",

    "selftext": "To put some context, his (28M) mother (54F) and I (54M) ended our relationship in the worst possible way and ended up turning our marriage into a mess. She cheated on me with two of her coworkers and I ended up cheating on her with our son's teacher, and if that wasn't enough I got her pregnant. At that point we both decided that no amount of couples therapy could save our marriage and we divorced because it was the best thing for everyone involved. \n \nAfter the divorce, my ex-wife and I had joint custody so we tried to be friends and be the best parents to our son, and it worked for a couple of years until she stabbed me in the back again. \nWhen he was eighteen he decided he wanted to know why our marriage had ended and she decided to break our deal and tell her version where I am the villain. And when I say she broke the deal I mean the deal we had where we both agreed that we would tell him that story together. Long story short he thinks her cheating is justified because I was a bad husband who didn't pay attention to her and ignored her, and she even told him that it was me who cheated on her first and that's not true, but he believed it anyway and since then he refuses to listen my version and we haven't talked since.\n\nA few days ago my wife (43F) (she is the woman with whom I cheated on my ex-wife) and I celebrated our 20th anniversary of marriage and since I know she loves jewelry, I decided to give her a gift that I knew she wanted. A few days later my brother, who always had contact with my son, told me that he needs money because his landlord is about to kick him out of his apartment. And I said that I was not going to give him a penny because he doesn't deserve it, that if he loses his apartment he can move back in with his mom.He has never given me the opportunity to tell him my version, he never wanted to speak to his siblings again (20M, 17M, 11M, 9F) and he also didn't apologize to my wife for the horrible things he told her so I don't want to hear from him until he apologizes like the adult he is. And thanks to that now my brother thinks I'm being an asshole because if I could buy such an expensive necklace for my wife I can also help my son with money, but as I said I don't think he deserves it. Am I the asshole for saying that?",

    "selftext": "So I decided to annihilate the Duergar who attacked the gnome colony in the Underdark when up walks a fat Spore dude named Glut who asked to help me out.  I thought 'the more muscle the merrier' and added him to the crew.  Glut's built like a mushroomy dwarf, which is endearing, so I'm happy with my life choices.\n\nWe went to the village and, as per my usual, I send in my stealthy gloom stalker main character to scout. He goes in and, because I've heard good things about collecting corpses for necromancers, I have him grab a few corpses off the beach for later. I have later game plans that involve Gale and a lot of dead bodies. My dude goes back to camp to drop the corpses on the ground, and because he's encumbered I don't bother putting them in any chests as they're too far away too walk to for my patience level. Then i go back to the main area and continue on.\n\nSide note: don't drop corpses in your camp if Volo is standing somewhere nearby.\n\nEventually we fight the Duergar with Glut's help. While Glut's kinda slow, he does a good job ressurecting the dead Duergar and helps win the combat, although his mushroom bodies really clog up some of the ledges. I'm especially happy because I figured out a way to catch the sneaky invisible dwarves with Cloud of Daggers since I foolishly didn't have anyone with a See Inivisble spell going into a fight with Duergar. In the end the fight feels like a good 7/10.\n\nWhen the fight's over I immediately dimiss my party members - it's easier when we're all bunched together in the real world rather than in camp where they're scattered - since I want to change up my squad for the next day. Then I go back to camp, ready to long rest. In camp, Glut starts a dialogue before I can do much and suddenly demands that I help it overthrow the other Sovereign.  I like the other Sovereign so I refuse, thinking he'll be tiffed by go off on his own. Instead Glut turns *aggressive* and the little dweeb who had 55hp a second ago suddenly doubles in height and has like 126hp or something like that.\n\nBut you remember that pile of corpses from earlier that I collected from the beach?  Yeah Glut starts animating them into mushroom people.\n\nMy one saving grace is that my dude was in the camp. While I had no fellow party members under my direct control, by running around I got them to join the fight under AI control to face Glut's Fearsome Fungal Fighting Force.  It was quiet satisfying seeing every single party member fighting at once Avenger style instead of just 4 at a time.  Although somehow Glut still had more dudes than I had campers at one point.\n\nSomehow my party and I defeated the traitorous turncoat of a toadstool and I vowed never to befriend portly Fungus dudes ever again.\n\nI love this game.",

    "selftext": "**9/1 Friday CFB Week 1 on FS1 | Central Michigan Chippewas vs Michigan State Spartans Betting Preview**\n\n*September 1, 2023, 7:00 | Spartan Stadium*\n\nIn the midst of the college football frenzy, the Central Michigan Chippewas are gearing up to clash against the Michigan State Spartans at Spartan Stadium. With both squads commencing the season with a spotless 0-0 record, anticipation is high for this matchup that will set the tone for their campaigns. This comprehensive betting preview takes a deep dive into the odds, recent performance, power stats, and head-to-head history to offer insights into why either team could cover the point spread, and whether the total points will go over or under the projected line.\n\n**Point Spread Projections**\n\n*Central Michigan Chippewas Covering the Spread*\n\nCentral Michigan enters this game as the underdogs, carrying a point spread of +14. While they haven't been consistent in covering the spread, having managed a 5-3 ATS record in their last 8 games, they've demonstrated a propensity to perform well against the spread. This suggests they could potentially keep the game within the spread, especially when facing an in-state rival like Michigan State.\n\n*Michigan State Spartans Covering the Spread*\n\nOn the other side of the spectrum, the Michigan State Spartans are favorites with a spread of -14.5. Historically, the Spartans have shown mixed results when it comes to covering the spread, boasting a 3-5 ATS record in their last 8 games. However, they have a commendable record of 8-4 ATS in their last 12 home games, showcasing their potential to cover on their turf.\n\n**Total Points Projection**\n\n*Going Over the Total: Central Michigan Chippewas vs Michigan State Spartans*\n\nThe projected total points line is set at 45.5, hinting at a moderately low-scoring affair. However, both teams have the capability to contribute to high-scoring games. Central Michigan has seen the total go over in 4 out of their last 5 games, highlighting their potential to generate points. Additionally, in previous head-to-head matchups, the combined score has often exceeded the projected total, suggesting the potential for a higher-scoring game.\n\n*Going Under the Total: Central Michigan Chippewas vs Michigan State Spartans*\n\nOn the flip side, Michigan State has displayed tendencies toward lower-scoring games, with the total going under in 4 out of their last 5 games. With their defense potentially playing a crucial role, the game might lean toward a lower total.\n\n**Game Prediction**\n\nTaking into account the ATS and OU trends, recent form, and head-to-head history, we predict that the Central Michigan Chippewas will cover the point spread, capitalizing on their ATS record and potential to keep the game competitive.\n\nIn terms of the total points, we predict that the game will go over the projected line of 45.5. Both teams possess offensive capabilities that could lead to a higher-scoring matchup, and their past head-to-head encounters further support the likelihood of a relatively high-scoring contest.\n\n**Final Score Prediction: Michigan State Spartans 31, Central Michigan Chippewas 21**",

    "selftext": "For context, my pwBPD is my ex-girlfriend of a four year relationship. My therapist strongly believes my ex-pwBPD is comorbid NPD and has more than a few sociopathic tendencies. A true dark triad. Lucky me. I broke up with her last July when her affair became far too obvious for me to keep believing her gaslighting attempts. As you all can guess, that was not the only time she cheated. She discarded me as soon as I started to put the pieces together regarding her past and current cheating. She monkey branched to the \"just a friend\" affair partner that she had a (trickle-truthed) sexual history with and moved out in October. We stayed low contact up until early November to sort out selling her patio furniture. It would\u2019ve been shorter, but I got Covid which delayed the buyer picking up the furniture. After that, I went no contact. \n\nI knew the hoover was coming. She\u2019s the only person I had blocked on Instagram, and somebody was using one of those anonymous Instagram story viewer websites that leave a random pornbot profile in your viewers. Daily. Sometimes more than once. Not exactly a mystery. And it's still happening.\n\nAnother thing: we unfortunately go to the same gym. It\u2019s currently the only affordable one within walking distance. Thankfully I don't see her that often. I\u2019ve caught her staring. I even caught her taking pictures of me working out about a month ago. I've always been fit, but over the last seven months I've gotten into the best shape of my life. She\u2019s gained a noticeable amount of weight. I\u2019ve been content to lift and ignore, though the unwanted photoshoot was disconcerting. \n\nThe official hoover came a few days ago. She asked about mail via text. I told her that I gave her everything I had up until our final conversation in November when her patio furniture was picked up. She asked about mail specifically from lawyers. Which is odd, because if she was missing mail from lawyers, wouldn\u2019t she just ask them to resend it? Seems basic. We all know it wasn\u2019t about the mail. Did she really think I wouldn\u2019t see through her? \n\nI responded like an idiot saying I hadn\u2019t seen anything, but I\u2019d check. I asked for some photos that she promised me ages ago aka the only reason I never blocked her number. I\u2019m not talking about photos of us. I asked for photos of my best friend\u2019s memorial service and the last Christmas I had with both my divorced parents and their partners before my mom moved across the country. My phone was stolen a month before our breakup, and she kept putting off sending all our photos to me. (I lost everything of mine due to being stupid and not having it backed up, but we took most photos on her phone because it was newer and had a better camera. She was already in the process of discarding me/monkey branching, and I think she liked the idea of having a carrot on a stick to torment me with.) She said she\u2019d try to find them and send them over. I didn\u2019t find anything, told her, and she thanked me for checking in a weirdly businesslike manner then immediately blocked me. My \"no problem\" text went through green. \n\nOnce again, she tried to use me. For what? I don\u2019t know. A reaction? I wasn\u2019t emotional at all. Maybe she just wanted to know if I would respond. I honestly would\u2019ve ignored her entirely if it wasn\u2019t for those photos. Now I know she never intends to send them to me. She is a transparently manipulative, mentally ill, wannabe Machiavellian, and I\u2019m so much better off having her out of my life. For starters, my immune system is finally back to normal after being sick almost all of last autumn. It's insane how much these people drain you. Thank god I never proposed. She would\u2019ve been the type to throw the ring during arguments.\n\nI feel stupid for responding in the first place, but I felt like I\u2019d be doing my deceased friend a disservice if I didn\u2019t try one last time to get those pictures. He told us once to be kind to each other if we ever broke up. He had a nasty breakup with his ex who had BPD (I think he realized about my ex on his own after witnessing her splitting) and didn\u2019t want me to experience the same thing. I like to think I honored his memory, but if there are any other attempts at contact\u2026 I\u2019m going to have to ignore them. Sorry, brother. \n\nI think part of me wanted to believe she had changed or grown. At least a little bit. Enough to feel some semblance of empathy. Or that nobody would be cruel enough to hold those photos over my head forever. Lesson learned. There's a reason why I kept all \"our\" friends and made new ones, and she has none. She tried to pretend she missed my friend almost as much as I did for a month or two, but I believe she just thought he would have helped her music career and was mourning her perceived lost opportunity.\n\nThe last time I saw my friend one-on-one was during a cold snap before the Covid lockdown. My ex was sending me scathing walls of texts insulting my friend while berating me and telling me to come inside. I hadn't properly caught up with him in ages as he\u2019d been on tour, and we spent the evening wandering around town chatting. We eventually sat on the stoop and talked for an extra hour. She wouldn\u2019t allow him to come inside, so instead we stayed outside shivering in order to continue our conversation. I remember my whole body was straight up shaking and teeth were chattering by the time his Uber arrived. Each extra millisecond with him was worth every bite of cold and every bit of rage she threw my way that night. I wish I had been able to tough out the cold longer. \n\nA few months later, she saw an article announcing his death and told me while I was in the shower.\n\nI've finally accepted those precious photos are gone forever, but at least now she is too.",

That was the part that sucked the most. Nothing was new. *Nothing*. The world had been stuck in a time loop for over a thousand years. Sarah grabbed a tennis ball out of the dumpster and tossed it out of the alley where a guy jogging by caught it.\n\n\"Thanks!\" he said as he kept going, on his way to play fetch with a golden retriever. He was one of many who had given up trying to change things and just enjoyed the good aspects of the repeated day ad nauseam.\n\n\"How many proms have we been to?\" Robin asked. It was their prom that night, as it had been for centuries. They'd gone with everyone in their school at that point. And everyone in every neighboring school they could reach by car in a day.\n\n\"I don't know anymore. Millions?\"\n\n\"Not possible but sure,\" Robin grabbed a rock off of the ground and threw it at the wall opposite her, \"Wanna go again?\"\n\n\"What else is there to do?\"\n\n\"Video games?\"\n\n\"Beat'em all.\"\n\n\"Only the good ones. We can play some crappy ones,\" Robin offered, \"Like that one with the worm in the space suit.\"\n\n\"Eh, we'd have to go over to Jared's to borrow his Megadrive. How about we just stay here?\"\n\n\"And talk about what?\" Robin asked, \"We talked about all the things. We've joined so many Purges even the serial killers have reformed out of boredom. We've had this same fight so many times you're lip-syncing me right-bubblegum.\"\n\nSarah froze mid-word as Robin threw that random bit in at the end and chuckled. \"Okay, we've been hanging out too much again maybe? Let's take a few decades break and meet up after we cool off?\"\n\n\"Sure, I guess,\" Robin said, heading back to the street, \"I think I feel like arson today anyway.\"\n\n\"Cool, have fun.\" Sarah did not have a trace of enthusiasm in her tone as they parted ways. Robin was having a hard time feeling anything lately either. The same faces every morning, the same people bustling about town. The only thing that had kept civilization from collapsing was the fact that every morning everyone woke up in their beds again.\n\nThe world reset.\n\nRobin grabbed an orange gas can out of the local hardware store - no point in paying, nobody actually worked anymore - and went to the gas station. Once it was filled she walked to the library and started to splash the gas around liberally onto every surface she could find.\n\nShe started in the history section for obvious reasons, but when she made it to the kid's section she saw a little blonde girl.\n\n\"Hi Robin!\" she said, waving at her.\n\n\"Oh, hey Becca,\" Robin sighed, putting the gas can down, \"Whatcha reading?\"\n\n\"The Little Engine that Could!\" Becca beamed at Robin and held the book up, \"Want to read with me?\"\n\n\"Ehh, I read it already.\"\n\n\"So did I but its still fun!\" the blonde girl said, pulling one of the small chairs out from the table, \"Read it to me?\"\n\nRobin looked at the gas can, then at the little girl, and sighed, \"Alright. I'll read it to you. *Again*.\"\n\n\"Yay!\" Becca hugged Robin as she sat down, \"You're the best book reader in town.\"\n\n\"Yeah yeah, thanks kid,\" Robin wrapped one arm around the child and started to read, \"Chug, chug, puff, puff, the little train rolled over the tracks...\"",

It started with the keyboard  sticking. For example, I'm in Path of Exile (game) and I click over to  Discord to type and myyyy typnnnngstaaaaats looking lllllllliketiiiis -  skipping keystrokes and repeating others.  Now, that's happening less,  but now the mouse is sticking where the cursor just freezes  periodically. This happens inside the game and even outside the game in  just Windows 11. Like, I'm browsing on Firefox to find troubleshooting  for my issue and the mouse sticks. I have nothing open but Task Manager,  Core Temp, CPU-Z, GPU-Z, and CrystalDiskInfo (just to see if the m.2 is  the culprit?).  Also, with the 3060 or the 1080, Path of Exile plays  like crap. Game sticks, freezing, frame drops, all that nonsense.\n\nI'm  out of ideas... I've tried a lot of stuff below. I cannot for the life  of me figure out what's going on. Why does my mouse and keyboard lose  power, freeze, cut out, stick on repeating characters? With just base  Windows 11 and a couple browser windows open? And why do my games play so bad with freezing/framedrops/etc.?\n\nCan anyone here help?\n\n**What I've tried:**\n\n1. physical  RAM test by removing one stick and booting the system with each one of  the original 2 RAM sticks - booted just fine with each\n2. Bought new RAM of the same type - problem persists with new RAM.\n3. New  MB - tried to Q-flash the BIOS to update the version. Nothing from  Gigabyte's web site was acceptable, I just got \"invalid image\" error on  every file version available from Gigabyte. So, I found an article that  said CyberPower is known for custom BIOS and that could be the problem.  Since I couldn't manipulate the BIOS version I just bought a new  motherboard all together.\n4. Combinations of old RAM and new RAM with a GTX 1080 and RTX 3060, and all four for 32GB total RAM. Problem persists.\n5. Fresh Windows install from a boot disk.\n6. RAM test a guy I know did where Windows boots into a RAM test on a blue DOS type screen (I forget what this is called)\n7. Tested  the system in another game - Lost Ark. This is the weird part. I don't  remember seeing any mouse cursor issues or anything with this game. So,  I'm testing this right now as I boot up Lost Ark. The mouse froze on me  when I'm just swirling the cursor on the screen as the loading art  displays. Once I'm in game, the LEDs on the mouse actually turn on and  off and it loses power entirely for a split second to two seconds.  Keyboard as I was typing in this post a couple lines above was sticking  with repeating characters. (This is with the GTX 1080 installed, and I  expect the same problem might exist with the 3060 installed but I  haven't tried that since putting in the new motherboard.)\n8. In Device Manager USB controllers I unchecked/disabled all of the \"Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power\"\n9. I'm in performance power mode, not balanced or power saving\n10. When  I installed the new motherboard I did get a tiny bit of thermal paste  on two pins because I'm a dumbass. The problem existed before this  happened and I spend about an hour and three fresh soft toothbrushes  with 99% isopropyl cleaning it super duper gently, and I'm confident  this worked. The problem is not worse since this happened, but the  problem does persist.\n11. I  disabled G-sync in the NVIDIA control panel. Some random article said  to turn this off. I don't think either of my displayers are G-Sync  compatible, anyway.\n12. From my old tower I borrowed my EVGA 850W Gold Plus PSU just in case it was an overall power issue. Problem persists.\n13. Did  a burn-in test on Furmark with the 3060 at 1440 QHD - the score was  5377 which seems low as a benchmark, but I'm not as familiar so... maybe  it's the GPU?  But the problem exists with the 1080, also, so I don't  know that the Furmark test tells us anything.\n14. I  thought it might be the network adapter originally since Path of Exile  is network-intensive, but the new motherboard is fine. Modem seems OK.\n15. Moved devices to different USB ports - mouse and keyboard\n16. Tried new devices - mouse and keyboard\n17. Also currently doing a stress test on the CPU using a tool called Prime95. So far everything says \"passed\" but as I'm typing this sentence the \"s\" character froze and repeated. ",

Depending on Hojbjerg)\n\nKelly / other unknown CB (Unknown fee but inexpensive. Depends on Sanchez + Dier leaving)\n\nIns that don\u2019t depend on any particular outs: Brennan Johnson (\u00a350m is what Forest want but we\u2019re attempting to include Sanchez in a deal)\n\nNot gonna lie, it\u2019s looking pretty rough w less than 24 hours to go lol\n\nI think we end up with Brennan and Kelly but Gallagher proves too difficult to do.

Panic aside, I knew some quick steps to regain control.\n\nStay Composed: I stayed calm and followed these steps:\n\n1. **Maintained Control:** Despite the black screen, the car was drivable. I held the wheel and maintained speed.\n2. **Hazard Lights:** Turned on hazards to alert others.\n3. **Smooth Slowdown:** Gradually eased off the accelerator, safely slowing down.\n4. **Safe Stop:** Changed lanes, pulled over cautiously.\n\nSolving the Issue: Parked, it was time to troubleshoot:\n\n1. **Soft Reboot:** Held both scroll wheels on the steering wheel. The Tesla logo reappeared after 10 seconds.\n2. **System Check:** Verified all functions in vehicle settings. No further problems.\n\nA black screen during Tesla driving can happen, but staying collected and using simple solutions makes a difference. It reminds us that even advanced tech has its moments, urging continuous local improvements for a safer drive. Share your experience with us in the comment!!!",

    "selftext": "I read some things about vaginas online that turned me off men and made me wonder why it doesn't turn other women off men, make them feel desexualised nor depress them, and why they would want to find exceptions when the bigger picture on a larger scale, is negative. The bare minimum you'd expect sexually of men as a gender is that they'd value vaginas. I became reclusive due to thinking that these things are casually believed and accepted\n\nI asked my parents, sister and psychologist about it, and they said:\n\nI read that men sexualise and fetishize women who have penises, but women and gay men don't do that with men who have vaginas. Proving penises are more liked than vaginas. My parents, sister and psychologist said that the vast majority of men have no interest in transgender women pre op nor post op and have no interest in women who have penises \n\nI read that oral is given far more to men than to women and that this isn't about male selfishness, since gay men are male and give the most oral of all. So the reason must be that vaginas are less appreciated. My parents, sister and psychologist told me that oral is 50/50 between men and women\n\nI read that vaginas are seen as gross, taboo and have stigma and that gay men are more openly disgusted by them than lesbians are by penises. My parents, sister and psychologist said they are definitely not seen in that way and that gay men are not more disgusted than lesbians\n\nI read that femdom is seen to be mostly about penis imitation in the form of strap ons and pegging and that those things are not seen as merely toys in a similar shape, but seen as replicas of penises. My parents, sister and psychologist said none of this is true\n\nI read that sex is seen to be defined by and all about penis/the most vital part. So lesbians have their sex validity questioned, whereas gay men do not. And I read that bisexuals are believed to prefer penises. My parents, sister and psychologist said that these things are not true\n\nI read that men are more attracted to a performance or costume of femininity rather than to actual women. So feminized men and penises are less of a turn off than an overweight woman or an unshaven woman who is showing her natural body hair. Whereas women and gay men are attracted to men, not merely masculinity. So androgynous men have always been heartthrobs and women and gay men would not find a masculine woman a turn on and would find vaginas more of a turn off than any type of man. My parents, sister and psychologist said men would rather any type of woman than a feminine man\n\nI read that vaginas are not appreciated as much as big penises, boobs and butts are. And that vaginas are seen as merely means to an end holes, while men love their own penises more. My parents, sister and psychologist said they are appreciated just as much as the others\n\nWhat do you think?",

Especially because you won't notice when they are gone...\n\nI am sending back the temp sensor, but I would appreciate your feedback. I will try to fix the vibration sensor since its time for a return is over, still, I  am disappointed and will look around to find another sensor provider, if a more reliable one exists.\n\nCheers!",

Ya pedimos el informe de dominio y el abogado nos dijo que tenemos que pedir un informe de inhibici\u00f3n de mi pap\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n. Por un lado me parece raro porque el informe de dominio ya tiene un apartado donde aclara si el auto se encuentra inhibido, por otro no lo encuentro para pedir en el DNRPA. Encontr\u00e9 un informe de inhibiciones en el Registro de la propiedad inmueble de Capital Federal pero no se sera relevante para un automovil.\n\n* Hace falta ese informe de inhibicion?\n* Se saca en el RPI?\n\nEl otro tema es la cesi\u00f3n de derechos, ac\u00e1 es donde estamos m\u00e1s perdidos. Entendemos que se presenta un escrito donde consta que yo cedo mi derecho hereditario sobre el auto de forma onerosa y no mucho m\u00e1s.\n\n* Existe un modelo de este escrito?\n* Hay que presentarlo firmado por escribano?\n* Se hace despu\u00e9s que est\u00e1 aceptado el auto en la presentaci\u00f3n de bienes?\n* Adem\u00e1s de la tasa de justicia, hay que pagar una transferencia para inscribir el auto?\n\nMuchas gracias por la atenci\u00f3n!",

    "selftext": "Today as I was driving from Maine to Upstate NY, I was on I93 right before the Epping exit when the front bumper of my Toyota Highlander (which was a little bit damaged) dislodged & went underneath my car. I was with my 2 young daughters and totally panicked and had to pull over to the side of the highway. I didn\u2019t know what to do and within minutes a car pulled over to help me. It was a maroon Toyota Venza with 2 very nice Haitian men who immediately began to help me. They laid on the ground trying to tie up the piece that broke off (it was connected with bolts and we didn\u2019t have proper tools). They did the best they could with a little lace I had. They tended to my car for at least 30 minutes and then offered to guide me to their local mechanic on Beech St. in Manchester. They were going to follow me all the way there to make sure I was ok. However when I started to drive the lace broke and I began to drag again. Luckily the very next exit was Epping and it had a Toyota dealership right off the exit. The 2 men continued on their way probably knowing I\u2019d be safe. I tried to give them some money when were on the side of the road but they refused. I did thank them but I wish I could let them know how much I appreciated their help. There really are good people out there and today I was reminded of that. If anyone on here may know who these guys are, please let them know how much they helped this stranded Mom on the side of the highway! \ud83e\ude75",

    "selftext": "I am working on figuring out what is the best setup for streaming. But specifically streaming using a debrid service trying to watch TV shows that are not so mainstream.\r  \n\r  \nI like shows some do not. I like all the British archeology/antiquities shows, treasure shows, salvage and diving shows, mining shows, some but not so much the dumb US conspiracy type treasure shows etcetera. A lot of documentaries as well and adventure.\r  \n\r  \nProblem, not everyone is watching them. So debrid links are not as popular.\r  \n\r  \nI started years ago with Premiumize me. I got it because of the fair usage system in that I could share the account with family that I set up streaming boxes for. For them I now use Weyd and Stremio with Torrentio as a back up.\r  \n\r  \nThen I got Read Debrid for me to get more links and It usually did over PM.\r  \n\r  \nI like Weyd because it is inexpensive and is Trakt compliant.\r  \n\r  \nI set family up with Stremio also because it free and easer for them than KODI. I only set them up with Torrentio with debrid so all they use are debrid links and have no need for VPN.\r  \n\r  \nFor me I also will use KODI with Fen etcetera. I basically have tried whatever would take debrid.\r  \n\r  \nI have a prejudice against Syncler and Orion because they are paranoid and take it out on the customer expecting you to use Krypto or pay a premium to a reseller. So I have never tried Syncler + and have only used free Orion on Torrentio.\r  \n\r  \nBack to Premiumize, OK links but not as popular of a service due to it being pricy especially just for streaming. So less links hosted. I will continue to use it for sharing the service unless I figure out something better for setting up and for ease of maintenance less work for me.\r  \n\r  \nSometimes PM does have links that RD did not but usually RD has more in general including more of the less popular stuff.\r  \n\r  \nI was going to try Orion to complement the debrid services I had and see if that would bring more less popular show links. If I understand them correctly it should. It did seem to offer some additional when incorporated into Torrentio on Stremio but some were dead and of bad quality and then I would run out of them fast forgetting to use them wisely when searching around and do not use that often since it does not integrate with Tract well.\r  \n\r  \nI have always wondered if the key is better scrapper. With Weyd I use /weydx scraper. Seems to be the one everyone recommends.\r  \n\r  \nSo, I just got AllDebrid instead of Orion that I was wanting to try. I went back and checked episodes that had no debrid links available with PM and RD and had some success. Alldebrid seems to access more of the obscure shows. a guess right now is I get a third more or was able to watch about a third of the episodes I could not get links for with RD and PM.\r  \n\r  \nSo I am wondering what others have tried and what they use to get the most usable links especially debrid links.\r  \n\r  \nI don't care as much as most do about the most 4k links on popular shows. I can achieve that with PM, RD or AD. It seems that RD is best for that since it is the most popular. It seems to generate the most links in general but not necessarily the most of the lesser known or perhaps I am getting more British shows hosted with Alldebrid. I am in the US but do watch some of the British and Australian shows.\r  \n\r  \nPM is best for sharing or using their VPN and all they offer, but for must it is not cost effective so seems to have less links available for streaming.\r  \n\r  \nAlldebrid may have the most links to the less popular shows but slightly less overall than RD hosts.\r  \n\r  \nWhat is your experience? I hoping someone familiar with Orion or other scrapers services like Easynews could explain if it is worth the hassle to pay them also or not. I better free scrapper script would be great. \r  \n\r  \nI am going to reset up KodI....Again....and was thinking maybe trying something different if I can.\r  \n\r  \nI like Weyd righn now but do not like how the most popular shows are generated. I have nothing against Indian people but it seems they dominate the pirate streaming world so it now sucks for people that do not watch Hindi shows on a few different platforms now. It makes Weyd kind of sucky for all others who are not interested in bollywood shows. Anyone know how to tune that out with them?\r  \n\r  \nYes I know I can go torrent entire seasons myself. I may end up going back to that. Thank you",

I'm a programmer, and I've lost the ability to work on projects at home because I can never bring my laptop out and use it because the house feels contaminated, and I know that you can't easily clean a laptop. I also have a book collection, and books are also noncleanable as well. I constantly feel like I'm in hell because anytime I feel like the contaminant I'm worried about receding something new happens that ruins my next couple of weeks/months. I know ERP is the answer but it's so hard because I know I'm logically right about how the contamination spreads. Like I had an incident where cigarette smoke got into the house and I'm still smelling it, so it would be true that if I use my laptop during this time that it would inevitably become contaminated with the smoke. And then just repeat this thinking for every thing I'm worried about, and the time never comes where I feel safe using my things.",

    "selftext": "Like if you're AMAB or AFAB, it's still possible for people to see you as non binary, no matter how you present. But what is the difference in how they are perceiving you than if they perceived you as your AGAB? Like, WHAT exactly are they perceiving. Say for instance you tell someone you are non binary but you don't change anything about how you perceive yourself, but in this case they genuinely start seeing you as non binary instead of your AGAB. They are perceiving you in a different way somehow, but I don't know how to describe exactly what it is.\n\nOr for example if a straight guy who only likes girls meets someone who is AMAB but identifies as a girl, but is still pre-transition and presents as a man. Now say that this straight guy knows she is trans and sees her completely as a girl, despite her physical appearance. Because of the way he perceives her, he develops romantic feelings for her even though her appearance is male. If everything was the same about this girl except for instead she identified as her AGAB, which is male, he would not be romantically attracted to her. This is possible, right? I don't really get how it works. How can something  which is such an abstract concept so largely influence his romantic attraction to this person? I know the difference in how he sees her is how he perceives her gender, but, like, how would you describe what he is seeing different without using the word \"gender\"? Something is different in how he sees her, but WHAT is it?\n\nAnd for another example, say someone fully transitions and passes very well. They meet someone who does not know they are trans and thinks that the person they are talking to is their AGAB, and they see this person as the gender they identify as. But then the person tells them that they are trans, and this other person starts seeing them as their actual AGAB just because they told them they are trans, even though nothing else has changed. I don't get WHAT this person is seeing different. I mean, I know what it feels like to see someone as a gender other than how they physically look or present, but I really don't get exactly get what I'm feeling that is different then if I saw them as another gender. I can't describe what it feels like to \"feel\" that someone is a girl or boy or non binary, even though I have felt it before. I guess what I'm trying to ask is, if gender perception is not perceiving someone's physical characteristics, then what is it? I'm not talking about cases where people use people's preferred pronouns out of obligation, I'm talking about where they genuinely see those people as the gender they identify as, no matter how they look or sound or act.

In the realm of relationships, it's important to keep an open mind and embrace the unique experiences that people bring into our lives.\n\nWhen considering a potential partner, it's important to remember that everyone has a unique journey that has led them to where they are today. Having three baby daddies might indicate that this person has experienced various relationships and has grown from those experiences. It shows their capacity to love, adapt, and learn, qualities that can contribute to a rich and fulfilling relationship.\n\nSimilarly, having four pitbulls showcases a sense of responsibility and compassion. Caring for pets requires dedication, patience, and a big heart. Someone who has taken on the responsibility of caring for four pitbulls demonstrates their commitment to the well-being of those they love.\n\nThe number of baby daddies or the number of pets doesn't define a person's worth or the potential for a successful relationship. What truly matters is the individual's character, values, and their ability to communicate and connect with others. Each person's story is unique, and embracing that uniqueness can lead to wonderful and unexpected connections.\n\nSo, dear gentlemen, as you navigate the world of dating, remember that the past doesn't dictate the future. Embrace the lessons and experiences that life has offered to potential partners, whether that includes multiple baby daddies or a pack of loyal pitbulls. What matters most is the genuine connection, understanding, and respect you share with each other.\n\nWishing you open hearts and open minds on your journey of love and companionship.",

First thought was that I'd have to upgrade my GPU to keep up... but I'm not sure how my build will handle a newer card.\n\nCurrent build:\n\n* CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 2600X 3.6 GHz 6-core\n* GPU: MSI Armor GTX 1060 6Gb \n* RAM: Kingston HyerX 16Gb (2x8) DD4 3200 CL16\n* Motherboard: MSI B450M PRO-VDH MAX (PCIe 3.0 x16)\n* PSU:  Thermaltake Smart SE 630W\n* SSD: Crucial MX300 525GB 2.5\"\n* Monitor: LG 29WK600 2560x1080 75Hz\n\nMy goal would be to game at 3440x1440, while making use of the 165Hz. So that would mean at least a RTX 3080, if I've checked benchmarks correctly.  \nShould I future-proof and get an even more powerful GPU? Would my CPU become a bottleneck at that point? And if I upgraded down the line, would my motherboard even support all that? What about the PSU? Or is there an even more glaring bottleneck that I'm not even seeing?\n\nIt kinda snowballed. So I was wondering, if I did get a new monitor + RTX 3080 (or better?), what would be a good upgrade path for my build? Could I go for a bit without changing anything else? At what point will the other parts become a problem?\n\nTy in advance \u2764\ufe0f",

Now they\u2019re banning us from talking to each other about what\u2019s going on and writing us up for it.\n\nThe problem? There are not enough desks and computers to sit at and work. I\u2019ve been working remote. Now they want me to come in, bring my personal laptop (yes, personal) and work in a patient room that\u2019s unoccupied because the doctors want to ask us questions in person. My job can be done 100% remote. \n\nWe must work in this clinic. Not only am I upset, but the coworkers I work with are. They decided to switch clinic rooms into patient beds at night (for sleep tests) then switch back to clinic tables during the day. Only because the hospital wanted revenue to save $$ on clinic and testing areas. They\u2019re making the nurses move huge beds everyday. \n\nThere\u2019s a huge lack of security issues with patients as well and not enough space. We talk to each other to come up with ways to solve the issues and suggestions. \n\nWe brought up these issues. Management is mad that we talk to each other. We all got scolded at and banned from talking to each other. We are also not allowed to have team meetings - only the managers meet about issues. \n\nCan an employer do this?",

I am a black female. There are only two black girls in my year, and three mixed girls.\nMy school has a policy that only natural colours are allowed, you know like your typical blond, brown and ginger. People get highlights and balayages with colours like that all the time, so i decided \"why not? it's cute!\" Taking that into consideration, i decided to get blonde/ brown\n\"highlights\" (just brown and blonde braids done in with the rest of my hair which is dominantly black).\n\nOn my first day back when i was in registration, and was pulled out by my head of year. i was expecting it to be an earring check as typically last year i would wear large golden hoops and would be checked for them as i never took them out. Instead, i was shouted at for having blonde and brown in my hair, being told that \"it is not a natural colour\" and that \"i know the school regulations\" even though my best friend also had blond highlights in her hair (she's mixed) and nothing was said to her. This is not the first instance i have had a problem like this in my school. in previous months, my other mixed friend had matching blond peekaboo braids with the other black girl in my year, and guess what? only my black friend was shouted at? (peekaboo braids are coloured at the back and covered with black hair at the front).\nThis not being the first time i've been called out for my hair for literally no reason, i went into a fit of rage, went home and told my mum that i am either going to be moving for 6th form, or i'm going to tech. she said no. i laughed in her face and said \"if you think i will thrive in that school you are wrong, because i will self destruct myself.\" me saying this upset my mum and she hasn't spoke to me since.\n\nAITA?",

That's it. I don't know why, I'm guessing the guilt of abusing your daughter in every way possible for 11 years finally got to him.\n\nWhen I was told the news, I really didn't know how I was supposed to feel. Sad? Happy? Honestly the main two things I felt were relief and grief. Relief that I wouldn't have to fear my father would decide to return one day and get revenge for me reporting him to CPS. But also grief from one simple thing. I'll never get a dad. Not the kind i had that would beat me daily, but the kind that would hold u at night and play games with you, maybe even take you to the toy store as a treat. I think in a way I'm grieving what I should've had. \n\nI came to terms with what happened, I truly hate my father, he's left me with various issues physically and mentally. But dammit, a part of me was still hoping, deep down, that maybe he'd come to the door and say he was sorry, truly this ttime. But now ill never get that, I won't get any closure, he's just dead now, and there isn't anything I can do.\n\nI didn't go to the funeral, and apparently my relatives took issue with that, since they all haven't talked to me outside of my older hald-sister. One of my aunts even had the gull to say he loved me at one point, that he sacrificed a lot for me, and in the end \"he's still my dad\", just to make me feel guilty. It's like just because he's dead, suddenly everyone wants to forget what he did and focus on the few good moments. Which is fine, but the fact they try to force me to forgive him just because he's dead is not helping my complicated feelings right now.\n\nI hate how I miss him, well, what he could've been. The man tried to kill me 3 times, groomed me, abused me daily, shamed me for hurting myself as well as being depressed, and yet, I wish there was a way he could've actually changed, even though I know that probably couldn't happen, knowing it never will just guts me up inside.",

    "selftext": "I read some things about vaginas online that turned me off men and made me wonder why it doesn't turn other women off men, make them feel desexualised nor depress them, and why they would want to find exceptions when the bigger picture on a larger scale, is negative. The bare minimum you'd expect sexually of men as a gender is that they'd value vaginas. I became reclusive due to thinking that these things are casually believed and accepted\n\nI asked my parents, sister and psychologist about it, and they said:\n\nI read that men sexualise and fetishize women who have penises, but women and gay men don't do that with men who have vaginas. Proving penises are more liked than vaginas. My parents, sister and psychologist said that the vast majority of men have no interest in transgender women pre op nor post op and have no interest in women who have penises \n\nI read that oral is given far more to men than to women and that this isn't about male selfishness, since gay men are male and give the most oral of all. So the reason must be that vaginas are less appreciated. My parents, sister and psychologist told me that oral is 50/50 between men and women\n\nI read that vaginas are seen as gross, taboo and have stigma and that gay men are more openly disgusted by them than lesbians are by penises. My parents, sister and psychologist said they are definitely not seen in that way and that gay men are not more disgusted than lesbians\n\nI read that femdom is seen to be mostly about penis imitation in the form of strap ons and pegging and that those things are not seen as merely toys in a similar shape, but seen as replicas of penises. My parents, sister and psychologist said none of this is true\n\nI read that sex is seen to be defined by and all about penis/the most vital part. So lesbians have their sex validity questioned, whereas gay men do not. And I read that bisexuals are believed to prefer penises. My parents, sister and psychologist said that these things are not true\n\nI read that men are more attracted to a performance or costume of femininity rather than to actual women. So feminized men and penises are less of a turn off than an overweight woman or an unshaven woman who is showing her natural body hair. Whereas women and gay men are attracted to men, not merely masculinity. So androgynous men have always been heartthrobs and women and gay men would not find a masculine woman a turn on and would find vaginas more of a turn off than any type of man. My parents, sister and psychologist said men would rather any type of woman than a feminine man\n\nI read that vaginas are not appreciated as much as big penises, boobs and butts are. And that vaginas are seen as merely means to an end holes, while men love their own penises more. My parents, sister and psychologist said they are appreciated just as much as the others\n\nWhat do you think?",

So I am at the first and likely not last point where you fight porky (in his spider form) and have no items. Basically all I have is a magic jelly, some hot spring eggs, and a secret herb. That's it. There is absolutely no way I can beat pokey with no items. I used all the ones I had on the huge killer pig thing and the porky robots.

There\u2019s not a lot of passion or ambition.\n\n  \nHe\u2019s extremely frugal. If we go to a wedding in another city- he refuses to stay at a hotel. Instead we couch surf at his friends\u2019 place. On our one year anniversary, we slept on the floor of his friend\u2019s place when we were in town for a wedding. He didn\u2019t plan anything special. He asked if his 21 year old friend could come along for the ride. I thought he would\u2019ve planned something- even a late night walk would be okay.\n\n  \nWhen we go out and eat- if there\u2019s no tap water, he does not believe in buying bottled water. He also doesn\u2019t believe in buying popcorn or anything else at the movies though he asks me if I want anything- I know fundamentally, he thinks it\u2019s a waste of money.\n\n  \n4) We have never brought up sex until the conversation before we broke up. He tells me he doesn\u2019t believe in pre-marital sex\u2014 yet he doesn\u2019t go to church anymore and isn\u2019t religious. I respect that he wants to wait until marriage- but we don\u2019t do anything more than just kisses and hugs etc. I\u2019m not normally a touchy person and when we first started dating, have mentioned that- but it\u2019s been 1.5 years and we\u2019ve slept in the same bed several times but there\u2019s nothing beyond just holding hands and sleeping next to each other. I honestly questioned his sexuality and just felt extremely insecure.\n\n  \n5) He has a lot of platonic female friends. Which I\u2019m fine with l, however, a few months back he told me he wouldn\u2019t be able to make it to our date night because he was going to a concert with a female friend\u2026\u2026 the lack of respect and understanding that that\u2019s not okay baffles me. I know nothing is going on- but the fact he thinks that is okay again just makes me feel like he\u2019s acting like a boy.\n\n  \n6) I do appreciate him for picking places for date night each week to eat and for driving 40 minutes each Saturday to see me\u2026but that\u2019s all he does. There\u2019s not a lot of thought that he puts in the relationship.\n\n  \nWhen it all comes down to it- this is someone that just wants to live life and hang out with friends and go to concerts. And that\u2019s okay- but I don\u2019t feel prioritized and tbh- I think he\u2019s with me bc I fit all the boxes. I didn\u2019t feel like I was special to him and I cannot accept being with someone that makes me feel that way whether it\u2019s true or not.\n\n  \nI had a hard time seeing him being my husband or the father of my kids.",

    "selftext": "So there\u2019s a couple of coaches at my Krav Maga gym, a father and son, who I feel have been micromanaging me since the middle of July. \n\nEssentially it\u2019s because they\u2019ve said that my fight stance is off, that\u2019s fair. If I\u2019m messing up on my fight stance, I\u2019m glad to learn how to improve.\n\nThey problem I\u2019m having is that it was starting that my stance wasn\u2019t wide enough, or my foot was sticking out a bit. Again, that\u2019s fair. If it\u2019s a little something that will help me out, I\u2019ll take it. But if I keep my stance wide, make sure I\u2019m squared up, just the same as everyone else, they still hover over me and tell me I\u2019m doing it wrong. They tell me that I\u2019m too wide, my stance is slightly narrowing, I\u2019m not supposed to move so much, I have to move it a bit. What else I notice is that some people in the class will have the same stance that I do, but the two don\u2019t say anything to them. \n\nFor awhile, I was trying to work with them, ask questions, and find time to improve, but it\u2019s still off to them. Eventually, it was getting to a point that they just kept all eyes on me over anyone else, and just nitpicked everything I was doing. Some friends in the class even noticed this. And in another class, the son shouted loudly, \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to work with him for three weeks now!\u201d This made me feel kind of embarrassed since I still had all eyes on me. \n\nI\u2019ve been going to this gym for over a year and no one\u2019s said anything prior to this. I\u2019ve even talked to a few other coaches about my stance and they keep telling me I\u2019m fine. One of them even said I shouldn\u2019t be keeping it as wide as the two coaches told me.\n\nThe thing is, I feel they have good intentions in trying to help me with something I might be struggling with. I want to work with them, just like I want to work with any coach there. I just wish\nI wasn\u2019t so micromanaged by them, especially in the middle of a class. I want to talk to them, but I feel like I just can\u2019t. \n\nTl;dr: a couple of coaches at the gym I\u2019ve been going to for awhile have been micromanaging me over my fight stance. I want to fix it if it\u2019s wrong, but I feel as though I\u2019m not good enough.",

    "selftext": "So, to preface this, I don't suffer from a lot of the issues that are stereotypically associated with my problem. My female friends and siblings say I'm above average attractive, fun to be with, and not a jerk. I have spent my life surrounded by women (many sisters and platonic female friends) so I'm sensible to the issues women face, and I'm not actively prowling for sex, or even most of the time for a romantic connection at all. \n\nI say this not to (humble) brag, or to preclude the possibility of there being some larger issue with me, but I've thought about this for a long, long time, talked about it with the people close to me, and the conclusion seems to be that there's nothing inherently wrong I absolutely need to change. So, I've just figured \"I'll take it as it comes, it'll happen when it happens, I'll meet the right person eventually, and trying to force the issue would hurt more than it'd help.\"\n\nIn short, I've tried to keep the faith.\n\nBut I'm 24 and never had a serious connection with... Anyone. I've watched my friends, acquaintances, and even (significantly) younger sisters all have multiple passionate relationships, casual flings, and even a few marriages. I went through all of college in an overwhelmingly female field and school surrounded by beautiful and fascinating women, and there was just... Nothing. I made out with three girls at parties, one was from out of town, one was uninterested, and one was a psychopath who tried to rape a friend of mine. In a class that was apparently notorious for the amount of sex that was being had, I did nothing. I didn't even *realize* we apparently had that reputation. I must be the only guy to have left that promotion a virgin.\n\nAnd yet, all through college, I've kept the faith.\n\nI tried to make dating app accounts. I haven't gotten many matches, but I've gone out on a few dates, and there was never any real \"spark\". Usually though I just get ghosted at some point during the texting conversation. Often, I never get a reply after sending the first message. I've tried different approaches, different kinds of messages. I've tried basically every app worth mentioning in my area (a major city), and for each the outcome has been a shrug. Nothing.\n\nAnd yet, I've kept the faith.\n\nNow I'm out of school, I've started working, and because I no longer have access to the opportunities that being in college provided, I've tried to put myself out there a lot more. I've picked up new hobbies, new skills, tried online meetup groups, even gotten over my nerves and tried talking to women in bars and cafes, always trying to remain respectful, backing off if they aren't interested, even getting a few phone numbers (that led nowhere down the line). At the same time, I've kept up the dating apps, getting better pictures, better bios, better everything, even involving my friends for outside opinions as I'm apparently terrible at realizing that a picture of me is good.\n\nI've consistently and diligently worked on improving myself and putting myself out there, reevaluating myself, trying to put myself in the situations that might lead me to meeting someone and hitting it off. And I've got nothing to show for it.\n\nAnd at this point I'm finding it really difficult to keep the goddamn faith.\n\nThe more years this has lasted, the more my thoughts have spiraled into dark places. Maybe there's something wrong with me? Maybe my friends are lying about me being attractive to boost my flagging self-esteem? Maybe I just have a repulsive personality and I don't even realize it? Maybe it's my low self-esteem driving women away in some sort of vicious cycle I'm not exactly in the right mood to appreciate the irony of. \n\nI'm the last person I know in my group of friends and acquaintances to still be a virgin, but it's not even the sex I care about. Sure, I'd love to try it, and I frequently fantasize about it, but I mostly just want someone to talk to about my day, who'll hug me when I'm down, who I can have inside jokes with and just generally... Share *moments* with. Having someone else in my life, man. I try to shake it off, knowing that appearing desperate would do nothing to help my chances, but I've been carrying my loneliness for years and I just want to put that weight down and take a deep breath knowing that I'm not alone. \n\nI feel like a man who's never seen the sea, and wonders what it could possibly look like. I've read all about it, seen it in the movies, heard it described in every song, and my friends have swam in it and come back tanned and with brine in their hair and told me about the storms, and yet it still all sounds impossible to me, like it couldn't really exist. I know lakes, and it's supposed to just be a bigger lake, and yet even I know that's not true. So what *is* it like?\n\nI hope I get to hug someone, some day, and know that everything is right with the world. I hope the sea's out there for me, too.",

    "selftext": "\nHi guys I need some advice here. So my sophomore year of college I was forced to get a random roommate by my parents (didn\u2019t want a roommate tho as I\u2019m kind of antisocial and don\u2019t like meeting people cuz also social anxiety) Anyway so since I don\u2019t like meeting people and really like keeping to myself (had no friends in uni) I didn\u2019t talk to my roommate at all. \n\nWhich I\u2019m 100% sure my roommate hated me for that as she constantly kept trying to talk to me/befriend me and I never tried. And also my roomie also said they were extremely extroverted\u2026 and I overheard once that she felt lonely cuz she felt like she was living alone and she said this to her friends over the phone. Anyway for the rest of the year I didn\u2019t talk to her/ignored her and moved on with my life and did not keep contact with her\n\nThen recently I decided to stalk her and her friends social media cuz I didn\u2019t do that before and I was bored/curious about her. And then I noticed that she and mainly her friends made multiple inside jokes that were indirect references ABOUT ME on instagram, making a short film scene with these jokes and even a short on TikTok that got a few million views which her friend made to obviously make it harder to trace back to her. Now obviously she or her friends did not say my name or reference me specifically but the topics of these jokes I knew for sure that only happened between me and her. And now I know for sure that she exposed me to all her friends (she was one of those super extroverted popular type of girls as she had her friends come over everyday too) for probs being a loner, not talking to her, and also I was kinda unhygienic sometimes\u2026 and she made jokes about this. Meanwhile I did nothing to her I literally had no friends in college and had extreme social anxiety and she probs gossiped and ruined my reputation secretly.\n\nOh yeah and another thing is that one of her friends decided to join a club that I was a part of and stalked all of my convos in the group chat\u2026 like wtfffff and she did this through my junior year of college year and I only found out that was her friend until after I stalked her ig and TikTok which was this year my senior year\n\nAnd btw I found all this out my senior year of college and now I graduated. Like wtf I literally want revenge for her for doing that to me for stalking me and making fun of me and she def said this stuff about me to her friends and exposed me. And idk if this will somehow affect me in the future if anyone finds out I was her roommate and what they will think of me\u2026 as she def knows more people than me. I literally after being her roommate I left her alone and forgot about her and did nothing\u2026 meanwhile she did all these things. Advice? I don\u2019t want to confront her directly as I never talked to her in the first place and I was her roommate like 2 years ago and we both graduated? It literally makes me depressed this whole situation and it makes me no longer want to talk to people or even have social media anymore.",

Newer store, the lay out made more sense, everyone was nicer even though we were on inventory duty, etc. Basically, I could tell they had their shit together. \n\nWhen I came back to my older, far less staffed and far more hectic store, I almost immediately wanted to go back. Literally the first coworker I spoke to snapped at me for complimenting a Halloween display they were putting together.\n\nBefore I left, I spoke to a few of the employees at the other store about the chances of me transferring there since the same position I have at my current store was about to open up because of promotions (I'm an ISLG CSA). They spoke to the SM about it and relayed back to me that it wasn't possible because of poaching restrictions. Is there a way around this anyone knows of?\n\nIt felt like going from a cruise to a sinking ship and I haven't stopped thinking about it.",

    "selftext": "Well now I had to do I a shitty academic report (shitty in the sense of having to do a loooot of work) wich was supposed to be about comparing the Ressource policies of Germany and France, wich of course got out of hand in terms of length and Topic, I may have messed up a bit of citation formatting here and there but meh time got short at the end I really pushed the my schedule on tat one did a 12 hour sit on it to finish it but well its still not as perfect as it could have been. I asked the professor for an extension of 2 days but he couldn't give me one so well it got pretty close to the deadline and rushed it a bit so i hope I get a least a passing mark of 4.0 (fingers crossed). Well that is if he even looks at it, because I broke the deadline by 1:15 hours. How and why do you ask? Well because I didn't know about my University Emails pitfalls. \n\nWe got an Email service and a learning Plattform, now you can send an Email from the learning platform to your students, wich he did to remind us of the deadlines, but apparently you cant send an Email reply to the learning platform, neither did I notice that the email i replied to was send from the learning platform nor did I notice the small fine print between the lines where it said noreply, beacause you need to click on the name wich looks like the normal email adress name, only then will you notice that the Email is actually  a noreply, if you are however in a panic due to having 1 min till deadline passes you may or may not notice that its a noreply since you are already on to the next step the answer button. If you click answer it will not say noreply@.... but rather the name of the recipient you'd need to doubleclick on the name to to see the actual email behind it. I attached everything and well sent, logged out immediately and therefore didn't notice that I got an error message 30 seconds later, logged in one hour 15 later to see if the professor would send some sort of confirmation of receiving the mail and saw the error. \n\nI send all again for a third time to right email this time after getting error message for the second time and finally noticing that you cant reply to emails from the learning platform. I send a screenshot of the error and hope that the professor is not to tech savvy  and accepts my error screenshot as valid reason for missing the deadline without further question or contacts tech support otherwise he find out and may hold that against me. I hope he doesn't notice and accepts it.\n\nWhat do we learn from this? Just don't push finish 3-4 academic pages + Bibliography with reformatting sources in 1 day.\n\nTL;DR\n\nDidn't know and notice you can receive but not send emails from the learning platform to the students you'll receive an error message but with delay i was already logged out and pray the prof doesn't dig and find it out",

I experienced a similar freeze on BL as well so I suspect the same issue, but ctrtl+c bypassing was impossible (nosplash?).\n\nAnd fun fact, to get the ability to ctrl+c, it needs splash on kernel boot option.\nI figured out after apt rm plymouth plymouth-label libplymouth5. Yeah, I know, what the hell? I will explain some day ;)\nLuckily, I had a previous kernel installed in the advanced options!\nNoob note: you can press 'e' in GRUB to append \"splash\" or \"nosplash\" on linux line ([kernel parameters](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/kernel_parameters#GRUB)). \nAnd if you don't ctrl+c, it will heat a lot. Some reported that it will eventually pass after a 5 hours.\nI have compassion for my machine so I never waited more than 1 hour. I mean dude, it is an NVMe!\n\nI found out later that the check failed on vfat /boot/efi partition.\nI \"fixed\" it by editing /etc/fstab, line of /boot/efi, changing the last value with 0 (it is check's periodicity).\n\nI really think there is something wrong done during the installation process.\n\nIf you experience a freeze at boot, you can try adding \"fsck.mode=skip\" on the linux line in GRUB (see above).\nAnd some say you should not end the linux line with \"fsck.mode=skip\" else it would have no effect (yes I know; enough!).

    "selftext": "I met my partner when we were in high school. She was 14 and I was 16. It was the purest and happiest relationship I've ever had (even now). She left the country about one and a half years after we met. We tried a long-distance relationship, but obviously it didn't work. We both met other people during that time. I met and dated 4 girls, but none of them were the right one. The same thing happened to her.\r Now I'm 22 and she's 20. We're both studying at university in our respective countries (I'm an aerospace engineer, I love it). About a year and a half ago (yeah, again), we started talking to each other again.\n\nOur relationship is incredible right now. We've learned from our past mistakes and are now building a healthy relationship. We video chat each other almost every day, study together, and have a large, fully functional dashboard to help us stay productive. Most importantly, we listen to each other, which is crucial, especially during stressful times of the year.\n\nInitially, my plan was to graduate from university, gain as much experience and skills as possible, do my final internship in the city (or at least the country) where she lives, and then get a job. That would be great, but things aren't going well, and now I'm scared of the idea of Plan B: graduating in my home country and then moving to the country where she lives in a year past graduation to do a master's degree (without ruling out the possibility of getting a job in the meantime).\n\nThe problem is, I told her I would be with her in December, but it is now September and I still have not received any intern offers. I was even prepared to cover all expenses and do everything without pay. I don't know what to do, and I don't know how to tell her this. I still have hope of receiving an offer, but now the deadline is too close.\n\nRecently, we started talking about marriage. I want to, and she does too. But now, I'm not sure if it will happen. Another year and a half plus the six years we've already been far is a lifetime. And the idea of getting married without living together is crazy. We're too poor to visit each other often (we live 7,200 kilometers apart), and we can't afford to fly with our student salaries...\n\nFinally, I was thinking about paying for her flight, or at least helping her pay for it, so she can come to my graduation ceremony (in July 2024). If I do that, there's a possibility that I'll need to work an extra year to save up the money for my master's degree. But at least I'll get to see her again after 7 years.\n\nI just dont know what to do, I don't want to have this conversation with her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR!\n\nI met my partner in high school and had a great relationship. We tried a long-distance relationship after she moved away, but it didn't work out. We both dated other people, but never found the right oneso we started talking to each other again about a year and a half ago and your relationship is now incredible.\r  \n\r  \nI had planned to graduate from university, get a job, and then move to be with her. However, you haven't received any internship offers in her country yet and I'm not sure what to do. I'm also not sure if I can afford to get married without living together. I'm thinking about paying for her flight to my graduation ceremony, but i'm not sure if I can afford it. You're not sure how to talk to her about this.",

I don\u2019t really have much experience with people who have stutters, so I\u2019m wondering if there are any words of encouragement I could give him to help him relax or maybe just not say anything at all (like ignore that it happened).

When I started I was struggling with severe anxiety and depression, suicidal thoughts, addiction, PTSD etc. I have retrained my brain, I practice regulating nervous system, Im more emotionally regulated. I recently got my first career job and I\u2019ve left behind toxic people. It\u2019s not perfect but I\u2019ve made tons of progress from where I used to be. For the past few months it felt like I started a new chapter and was getting only moderate amounts of daily anxiety. It felt like I turned a new leaf and I felt mostly peaceful and pretty hopeful for the future. I\u2019d never felt hopeful/stable before so it was very refreshing.  But for some reason the past 2-3 weeks, something changed and now I can\u2019t calm down. I can\u2019t relax, can\u2019t focus on anything. I\u2019m finding myself getting trapped on tik tok, or avoiding things I need to do for hours/days. I feel on edge and I don\u2019t know what\u2019s caused it or how to make it stop. I just have the constant feeling that I\u2019m forgetting something very important. I check my schedule, calendar and alarms obsessively, Im talking a multiple times every hour. I feel so much anxiety that I\u2019m going to miss something, or forget something. I am starting to have lots of irritation and panic attacks again because of this. I feel there is too much in my brain and it\u2019s all falling out. This hasn\u2019t happened to me since maybe January/February. I can\u2019t get anything done because there\u2019s just too much. I don\u2019t have therapy session scheduled. How can I work on this on my own?",

Continuing to work for the place she works right now, which has severely impacted her mental health\n\n2. Accept the offer from the new place for $5,000 less than what she makes now (there is some weird bonus system in place where sponsors pay out leads for a study every month but when she asked about it the interviewers said \"the amount varies\" about how much these pay out and didn't seem keen on getting into any details on how much that is). She did say she got a good feeling about the workplace culture there and that everything seemed to run smoothly compared to the site now which is a cluster fuck. These people wanted to know by Friday at close whether or not she was going to accept\n\n3. Wait to hear back from the third place she interviewed. She really wants to work at this place because she would have good benefits and a 4 day work week, plus she would work with someone she knows well and works well with. She feels that the interview she had here went well but she felt that the one where she got the offer from went better\n\nWhat would you all recommend she do?

    "selftext": " \n\n1. become extremely familiar with your build and perhaps 1-2 others in terms of affixes needed on gear. Some are universally liked (vuln dmg, crit chance, crit dmg as examples) on certain pieces. Other desired affixes may be very class or build specific / niche.\n2. this enables you to eyeball scan your gear before you sell or salvage it. Look at EVERY SINGLE ANCESTRAL YELLOW - first compare to your own gear in case of possible upgrade, second, to see if it's worth selling on the open market. You only need three of the necessary four affixes on any piece, obviously, to make it salable. If the rolls are high on one or more of the affixes, you'll bring a higher price too. If it looks interesting...\n3. i use a specific auction site for mine, and you can easily find an auction site of your choice. I have made at least 15 sales through this website with no issues except the one item i accidentally deleted before someone won the auction. (I'm a dope!) It's very easy - screenshot an item, upload it, their website reads / pulls the affixes for you so you don't have to type them, and evaluates the item. It will often recommend a selling price based on similar previous sales, and allows you to post the item for sale right from the identifier page. So basically screenshot, upload, decide, click.\n4. PROFIT. I mean, really. You'll have enough money to pay 10M a roll and not really sweat it if you find a few good items that aren't upgrades for you (or are so slight of an upgrade it's better to sell for mega-millions). Every sale I've made has come through as expected. I even gave that poor soul whose item I deleted a free sword the next day because it cost me nothing.\n\nI've made over 350M gold this way. I'm currently sitting on about 300M, and I'm a very small fish. My biggest sale was 135M for a druid staff that was rolled pretty well and I think I could have gotten a LOT more for it. My average sale has been around 20M, and my smallest, 5M.\n\nThere should be an auction house in game; if people are doing it anyway, why not give us a good UI and the ability to make our transactions happen in game w/o the trading \"risk\" (there really is none).\n\nAnyway hope this helps some peeps get their needed enchanting rolls.",

I\u2019m working in south jersey and currently live in Philly, but I need to get out of the city. I\u2019m originally from Monmouth county and much of my family/ friends are there, so ideally I would like to be somewhere somewhat in between Monmouth county (by the beach) and where I work (close to Philly)\n\nI appreciate any suggestions as I begin the search for my first home purchase. I already got pre-approved for around $300k, and I am single living by myself so I don\u2019t need a lot at all, just would rather be paying towards a mortgage rather than rent. Online I\u2019ve seen a few condo/ town home complexes in south jersey within my price range with open units, I just haven\u2019t gotten the chance to check any of them out in person because I don\u2019t have a car at the moment. I sold my car soon after I moved to Philly because it was more of a hassle to have a car in the city than it was worth, but I miss the convenience of going to my family/ friends in Monmouth county which is one of the reasons I\u2019m looking to move to south jersey.

    "selftext": "Hello everyone- thanks for having me in the sub. I\u2019m going to try really hard to summarize my son\u2019s life with allergies because I just learned that he has a bunch of food allergies in the last month.\n\nMy son was born very premature and in the NICU we never had a problem (so we thought); he was mostly on expressed breastmilk and only fortified it with an ounce of formula (we used Enfacare Gentlease). \n\nAbout six months later, finally home from NICU he was diagnosed with dysphagia (problem swallowing liquids safely). We were told no more breastmilk, and urged to change his formula to Nutrimigen. We slowly transitioned him off the ebm fortified with gentlease and as soon as he was completely off the old diet and on the new, he began to have severe eczema. I mean he was itching constantly and scratching til he was bleeding. We asked pediatrician for allergy test but nobody would listen to us or acknowledge that there was a problem.\n\nBasically he ended up losing weight, got admitted to the hospital, they insisted that he has a bottle aversion and not a formula aversion, and tried to make him take another formula called Neocate by feeding tube and bottle. My son would starve himself all day when we were trying to feed him bottle; he also was not gaining weight in the hospital even after being there nearly 2 weeks! We got sent home to just work with him ourselves. We asked for allergy test and still we were told that they \u201ccouldn\u2019t do it\u201d that he needed a referral first.\n\nWell we got home and he still wouldn\u2019t eat the formula! We ended up getting him gentlease because it was all we knew he could handle aside from the ebm. That seemed to be fine\u2026\n\nThen he turned one and we discovered he was allergic to eggs. We were sad because it would have helped him gain weight if he could eat eggs.\n\nHe turned 2 and his nutritionist told us he needed to be on a higher calorie diet now that he was a toddler. Told us to try Kate Farms. Tried it for almost a month and it was obviously not working- he threw up every other bottle and his eczema was bad again. I demanded a change based on the experience we had at beginning of year with him being hospitalized for the lack of anyone listening to us.\n\nChanged his formula to boost kids. That\u2019s what he is on now. Told his new pediatrician last year at the 1 year check up that they still never gave him an allergy test despite us requesting it many times; so finally she writes a referral and they don\u2019t have an opening till this year. \n\nSince that time we had a close encounter with peanut allergy because dad was eating peanuts and our son just started breaking out in hives from sitting with him. We didn\u2019t know that we should have given him allergen foods before one because his nutritionist and every other person acted like he was strictly to eat formula.\n\nSo we finally got the allergy test in July. He tested positive for egg, peanut, tree nut (they did a blood test for that aspect and it showed he could have severe allergy to all the nuts), do, mice, and dust mite!\n\nBecause our son can\u2019t have peanut butter or any other butter derived from nuts, my husband got sunflower butter hoping it would help him gain weight. Offered a tiny piece of toast with some sunflower butter and he got a tiny bit on his hand and fingers so he licked it. He began coughing and then itching like crazy, had some hives and just very red itchy skin!\n\nWe are so confused because ALL the formulas except what he is on now had sunflower oil in them. We wonder if that was the reason he was so poorly after coming off ebm. His allergist acted like it was a bad thing to get a bunch of allergy tests done because it would drive parents paranoid to point of kid not eating anything and not gaining weight. Also she denied his formula ever being the problem, saying that eczema is in the skin and weather and other things trigger it. But I am skeptical of that now that we know he has sunflower allergy. \n\nSince we are all new to this, does anyone know for sure if all foods with sunflower oil can trigger the allergic reaction? Do things cooked in refined peanut or sunflower oil not trigger allergic reactions?\n\nIf anyone has some tips or anything we appreciate it!",

I know for a fact he wouldn't put in effort for surrogacy or adoption and I don't want kids bad enough to put I the effort, so obviously ivf is 100% off the table. I have convos with him every now and then to \"make sure he's happy\" with me alone, and even before we tried that one year he said he wouldn't leave me; he'd deal with not having kids. It's selfish of me, but I'd rather him resent me for not having them than me resent him for having them. The way I talk and act is very childfree. I'm sorry, but I really don't like kids... or babies... or toddlers.

It's just a harsh combo.   \nAnd taking into account this disadvantage I can't see any pros  and reasons to play there (but bare enthusiasm), despite that region was important and lucrative in reality: straits, slave trade, cultural intersection; and in the game it has no chances like other important regions (Caucasus and so on).   \n\n\nSo, I'd like devs to pay more attention to other regions and their potential to growth, because now they are just a background for central and southern Europe.  \nAnd add fucking gothic culture!

    "selftext": " \n\nHiya! This season, I tried to solve the murder on my own, without the help of Reddit crowdsourcing and the frankly frightening genius puzzle-cracking some of you are capable of. Like a diligent and pious sleuth, I avoided this sub entirely. \n\nBut now that I\u2019m sure I know who did it and the finale is a week away, I\u2019m gonna log my theory and rationale\u2026and I\u2019m gonna add lil illustrative gifs because I\u2019ve gone insane. \n\nNote --I haven\u2019t read the vast majority of people\u2019s theory posts so I really hope I can add maybe one new thing to the pile. Either way, I spent a frightening amount of time wrestling with Imgur and Markdown so I\u2019m absolutely posting this. \n\n**MY OVERLY ILLUSTRATED CASE FOR ULYSSES AS KILLER**\n\nLike the (slight) majority of this sub, I believe it was Ulysses. Edgar was an accident, that poisoned whiskey was meant for Feng, who is, (Ulysses believes) is the obstacle to the wife and family that is rightfully his. \n\n**ISN\u2019T IT ALL TOO SIMPLE THOUGH?**\n\nI know a lot of people hate the fact it seems too easy. But the confirmation of the murderer is hidden and a little tricky to work out, switched glasses notwithstanding. It basically comes down to sound design, a painting and some trousers. So let me explain why I think a series of submerged but detectable clues lead to only one conclusion. \n\nIn Travis\u2019s episode, we see the murderer for a split second. \n\n![Travis](https://imgur.com/gallery/t26D8FH)  \n\nAs Travis is jolted awake by Grace\u2019s scream, we see a pair of trousered legs running AWAY from the crime scene, past the knight and down the corridor. \n\nWe know they were directly outside Grace and Edgar\u2019s bedroom door as we hear their footsteps on Travis\u2019s pistachio nut trap. Nobody innocent runs AWAY from a desperate scream for help, especially when they\u2019re literally right there at the scene. They\u2019re either doing something they don\u2019t want to be seen doing or they\u2019re the killer. I\u2019m certain it\u2019s Ulysses and here\u2019s my reasoning. \n\nTravis\u2019s account shows five people arriving at the bedroom from the direction the trouser legs ran: Feng and Vivian\u2026then in the second shot, Sebastian, Isabel and Ulysses. \n\n![First on scene](https://imgur.com/a/m8wW2Bn)  \n\n![Second on scene](https://imgur.com/a/m8wW2Bn)  \n\nEveryone else is on the right - \n\nWe can discount \n\n\\- Zoe and Aniq (we see them arrive at the scene from outside in Aniq\u2019s ep)\n\n\\- Grace (still in bedroom)\n\n\\- Hannah (wrong direction and significantly lighter flared trousers - the running killer\u2019s were definitely black and not flappy)\n\n![She\u2019s just visible behind Aniq. Look how light her trousers appear](https://imgur.com/a/3oQirCd)  \nI feel very sad it's not Hannah because she's brilliant. \n\nWith Vivian and Feng discounted as we see objective footage of them in their bedroom at the moment of Grace\u2019s scream, we are left with Ulysses, Isabel or Sebastian. \n\nAnd closer inspection of Feng\u2019s episode, specifically the final scene in his bedroom, proves the murderous runner must be Ulysses. \n\nDanner\u2019s episode shows that Feng and Vivian\u2019s room is along the hall from Grace and Edgar\u2019s room. We see the same picture on the wall outside their room. \n\n![well awkward to have your Mum and Dad next door on your wedding night but never mind](https://imgur.com/a/0t2dBsn)  \nwell awkward to have your Mum and Dad next door on your wedding night but never mind\n\nThis confirms F&V\u2019s bedroom location \u2013\u2013 it's about 3 seconds of running from crime scene to their door. \n\nWhen we hear Grace\u2019s scream in Feng\u2019s episode, we literally hear the running footsteps coming to their door and stopping (it\u2019s right there in the sound mix), - there\u2019s a half second pause for U to collect himself and adopt that pose, and knock knock knock, oh look, Ulysses is here and he heard a noise!\n\nThere\u2019s no question that his position in the house aligns precisely with that mysterious pair of legs from the crime scene. If it was Sebastian, we would have heard those footsteps continue on AND Ulysses would have run into him. Yes, the running trousers do match with Isabel\u2019s costume too, but the footsteps are only a match to Ulysses\u2019 movements. It\u2019s him. \n\n**BUT WHY IS HE THERE AT ALL?**\n\nIsn\u2019t it a massive stupid risk, especially when you have no ties to the dead man? Why not lie low?\n\nThis, to me, is the trickiest part to work out. But here is my theory. \n\nThe premise is:\n\n1. Ulysses never intended to kill Edgar. Feng was the planned target. \n\n2. Ulysses did NOT work out that his plan failed until the morning. My guess is that he heard Feng strategizing or saw his light on very early (he\u2019d been up all night with business planning after all)\n\n3. Ulysses knew for certain that Sebastian had seen him tampering with a glass. This would lead fairly easily back to him upon a police investigation. Edgar glass was next to his bed and would surely be tested \u2014 not very many healthy men in their late 30s simply drop dead. And neither do their lizards. \n\n4. It was therefore imperative that Ulysses swap out the poisoned glass for a regular one. He would have reasonably assumed the police would be called immediately and therefore a stupid, desperate move \u2014 getting into the bedroom and switching the glass before Grace awakens \u2014 would have to be attempted if he wanted a chance of eluding prison. \n\n5. But! He did not manage it! Grace woke up just as he approached and he had to run to avoid being discovered at the scene. Knocking on Feng and Vivian\u2019s door was genius as it established him as coming TO the scene, even though the sound mix tells us otherwise. \n\nYEAH BUT DO YOU HAVE ANY PROOF OF YOUR STUPID GLASS SWAP THEORY?\n\nI do! And it\u2019s the fact that Edgar\u2019s body - and particularly his hand - was tampered with BEFORE Zoe and Travis did their body flipping investigation in episode 2. Look at the two close-up shots of Edgar\u2019s face and wedding ring finger. \n\nThe first is from Aniq\u2019s episode, as everyone first encounters Edgar\u2019s body\n\nThe second is from Grace\u2019s episode, moments before Zoe and Travis flip poor Edgar like a pancake. \n\n![Edgar\u2019s finger](https://imgur.com/a/wmBHIhW)\n\nHis finger is clearly significantly bent - and he\u2019s been dead for hours so that would have been hard to engineer, what with rigor mortis and all. \n\nThis is a super close-up shot too - and a repeated one. We\u2019re supposed to see it, it\u2019s no continuity error. \n\nTo me, this is clear evidence of Ulysses\u2019s attempts to get Edgar\u2019s fingerprints onto his substitute poison-free glass. After all, a completely print-free glass would be almost as incriminating as a poisoned one. Everyone saw Edgar clutching that thing. \n\nSo: Ulysses attempted to swap the whiskey glass before Grace awoke. He either succeeded or failed. But, what he did do after it became clear that he\u2019d been gifted more time is that he returned to the body and cemented his work by fingerprinting the new glass. \n\n**BUT HIS STORY \u2014 WHAT ABOUT THE Q-TIP IN THE BAG AND THE DNA AND ALL THAT?**\n\nThat, I think, is a cover story. It\u2019s a really good one because it\u2019s truth-adjacent. Agatha Christie does this all the time \u2014 the killer admits something quite big and because it seems like the truth has come out, we trust them thereafter. \n\nUlysses comes in to Aniq and Danner\u2019s interview with that story locked and loaded. He knows he has to explain what Sebastian saw. DNA is a really reveal because it\u2019s a real part of the story without being the literal truth in this case. \n\nI think Ulysses already knew that Grace is his biological daughter. I think there\u2019s no way a tech bro and bio-hacker like Edgar didn\u2019t test his hypothesis immediately. I also think there\u2019s no way a bio hacker tech bro didn\u2019t have the DNA of his future wife ready to GO. It also explains why Ulysses took but 3 seconds to jump up onto the dance floor and take over Grace\u2019s first dance. He knows Feng\u2019s right there. Doesn\u2019t matter. He feels ENTITLED. \n\n**WHY NOW THEN? WHY KILL FENG AT THE WEDDING?**\n\nI think Ulysses came to the wedding to reveal his paternity to Vivian, thinking it will change everything and she\u2019ll come back to him. And she refused him. Because, as she tells her daughters in Feng\u2019s episode it simply doesn\u2019t matter \u2014 Feng is the one she truly loves. And that tipped him, a literally traumatized war veteran, let us not forget, right over the edge. The moment she rejected him was the moment he started planning Feng\u2019s death. \n\nOKAY, SO\u2026MURDER WEAPON?\n\nThe missing Devil\u2019s Trumpet is from Feng and Vivian\u2019s room \u2014 I think Ulysses and Vivian had their confrontation in her bedroom and he took the flower then. Feng is so absent throughout this wedding celebration, there would have been plenty of opportunities for Ulysses and Vivian to be alone. \n\nHis logic? Remove Feng, the obstacle to him claiming his love and his daughter, and Vivian will fall back in love with him, as he nurses her through her grief. \n\nOf all the suspects, only Ulysses and Hannah have the immediate knowledge about Devil\u2019s Trumpet and its effect. I\u2019m discounting Hannah - her trousers are innocent! But thanks to Ulysses\u2019s knowledge, Feng will look like he\u2019s drunk and delirious, go to bed and die. It will be a tragedy but not an obvious murder. After all, everyone assumed Edgar\u2019s death was natural until Aniq noticed Roxana. \n\nI gotta assume that the Devil\u2019s Trumpet poison was made in Aniq and Zoe\u2019s bathroom on the day of the wedding. All it needs is hot water and time\u2026and Ulysses had plenty of that. Dude loves a bathroom. Which brings me to\u2026.\n\n**WHERE DID THE DNA/Q-TIP BAG EVEN COME FROM?**\n\nWell, literally any bathroom? It\u2019s very easy to put a Q-Tip in a clear bag. I\u2019d guess that Ulysses did it when he emerges from the bathroom opposite Edgar\u2019s bedroom in \u201cDanner\u2019s Fire\u201d \u2014 the Dutch Baby scene with Zoe. \n\nJust before U enters the scene, We hear the toilet flush so it confirms he\u2019s leaving the bathroom. This could be either the point that Ulysses washes the incriminating poisoned glass (it makes good sense to stow a glass in the opposite bathroom rather than be seen carrying it downstairs) and/or grabs a Q-Tip to make his DNA prop baggy. \n\n**COULDN\u2019T HE JUST BE HAVING A PISS?**\n\nIn a house so lavish that in Aniq\u2019s episode Danner exclaims there must be \u201cat least 5 bathrooms\u201d \u2014 why on EARTH would you choose the one directly outside the crime scene? Nah, he\u2019s got business to attend to. \n\n**DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING ELSE?**\n\nJust simple stuff! Zoe tells Grace that the way Aniq solved the last murder was by noting discrepancies in stories and finding a motive. \n\nI think I\u2019ve covered motive but it\u2019s super easy to note the discrepancy in Ulysses story. I\u2019m sure everyone has noted this but I must be completist!\n\nUlysses literally lies about his final encounter with Feng and what happens with the whiskey glass. Multiple other accounts disagree with him \u2014 most notably the objective reality of Kyler\u2019s video. \n\nUlysses\u2019s footage shows him take two empty glasses to which he adds ice and then pours a drink for his brother and himself. Feng reluctantly drinks a toast to Grace and takes one sip from the glass before leaving with his massive Bing.\n\n![absolute lies m8](https://imgur.com/a/33xU4RS) \nMate. You would have got away with it if you hadn't said all this. This is how Danner's gonna know.\n\nKyler\u2019s video shows that Feng\u2019s glass is already filled with whiskey and waiting for him as he approaches. We can assume that Sebastian did indeed see Ulysses poison the glass moments before. Feng does not take a sip or toast Grace. That\u2019s why he\u2019s not dead and Edgar is. \n\nHere\u2019s the glass ready and waiting is also confirmed in Aniq\u2019s account. \n\n![Lovely, semi objective Aniq](https://imgur.com/a/zq3bHbs)\n\nThere we go! Discrepancy detected! A notable lie in the specific place and time where lying is most telling of guilt. I wanted it to be Hannah too. But she tells the truth! Obsessively so! Ulysses is a traumatised tap dancer with a weirdly specific shamanic background and a long shower hog! It\u2019s him it\u2019s him it\u2019s 100% him, I\u2019d stake the trousers of my first born upon it.  \n\nAnd if these Imgur links don\u2019t work, I may weep openly. I\u2019m gonna press post and see.",

I don't know what I'm going to do when this franchise ends.\n\nThe situation: I'm pitching with Kat Stanza (SPD 63) on 1B and Sloop Whoopity (CON 83) at the plate. It's a full count, so the CPU goes for a hit & run. Sloop strikes out on a 105 MPH 4-seamer, and my catcher throws to second so fast, Kat is not even halfway to the base when the ball arrives. She actually stops and turns around because she's literally closer to 1st base than 2nd. She gets tagged out at 1st, so Cordova managed to throw out a runner without actually notching an assist.\n\nI need to start recording my games and sharing these, because this is getting absurd. More than ever, I wish the game tracked steal % for catchers, because thus far, the only successful steal against him came on an error where I threw the ball into center field.

I had a feeling it wasn\u2019t consensual but i didn\u2019t want it to be true. Then when we heard that clip from Stassi\u2019s podcast about production covering up for him and several other instances in the past where they protected the men on the show I got so MAD. It really brought me back to times when women I love and I had experienced SA. And in all these instances all these dudes just got away with it. And this isn\u2019t just like 1 or 2 occurrences. Pretty much every woman I know has experienced SA. This, among many other things, just really makes my blood boil when it comes to the patriarchy. I\u2019m tired of everyone always protecting men! And I do my best to not support things that strongly clash against my personal views. I\u2019m not perfect, of course. But even if I decide to watch dispite my strong distaste for how production has handled these things, idk if I could even enjoy the show. I think it would just make me mad bc I won\u2019t be able to stop thinking about this while watching. I didn\u2019t realize until Scandoval how prolific this has been throughout the shows history. I stopped watching at some point and then binge caught up once scandoval broke. But now I\u2019m not just mad at him, I\u2019m mad at the whole dang thing. And if it\u2019s true how much money he\u2019s making now, this dude has literally profited because of his illegal, violating, abusive, salacious deeds. I know they said pay was going to be \u201cperformance based\u201d and this whole thing brought the show back to life. But at the end of the day, this wasn\u2019t his plan. We saw how he was laying the groundwork to paint Ariana as the villain. He didn\u2019t want to look like the bad guy, but was too much of chicken shit coward to actually break up with her. As Lala said, this dude is dangerous and on so many levels. And he\u2019s just out here living his pathetic little dream of being a rock star (which he\u2019s terrible at), driving around in a rollie, hanging with young women, basically getting off with no repercussions. He didn\u2019t want to look like the bad guy,  But at the end of the day, he got wanted, out of the relationship and more fame than he ever would have gotten without this whole mess. Idk if I\u2019m going to watch. I\u2019ll probably just keep myself updated here and watch highlights yall post.

Oporba bi ovim referendumom mogla zadati \u017eestok udarac HDZu i to u savr\u0161enom trenutku, a gotovo je zagarantirano da bi u tomu i uspjeli.\n\nSmatram da bi ovakva inicijativa imala podr\u0161ku velikog dijela oporbe, a posebice Mo\u017eemo, Centra i Fokusa.\n\nAko su prije dvije godine suverenisti, prava\u0161i i neovisni uspjeli organizirati prikupljanje potpisa za referendum o promjeni valute - zbog \u010dega ne bismo mi mogli organizirati prikupljanje potpisa za ovaj referendum?\n\nMoj potpis je osiguran, a spreman sam i donirati nekakve novce za organizaciju, pa i volontirati osobno kada bi do toga zaista do\u0161lo.",

    "selftext": "So I've had this acne around my chin for over a year now and it just won't go away. It comes and goes in phases but when it comes it stays for a long time. I have no idea what causes it or how to make it go away. Could it be folliculitis or PD? Should I try Nizoral? I'm not sure. Any help and advice would be appreciated.\n\nI stopped applying tretinoin to this area but still use it on the rest of my face. I don't really get acne anywhere else than this now. I've tried changing my cleanser and moisturizer but nothing helps. I don't have insurance so going to a dermatologist isn't really an option.\n\nThank you in advance for your help!\n\nRoutine:\n\n* La Roche-Posay Toleriane Hydrating Gentle Face Cleanser, Daily Facial Cleanser with Niacinamide and Ceramides for Sensitive Skin\n* Tinted SkinCeuticals Sunscreen (morning or before going outside)\n* Aveeno Therapeutic Shaving Gel (when I shave)\n* Tretinoin 0.1 % (evening)\n* Olay Regenerist Hyaluronic Acid + Peptide 24 Gel Face Moisturizer (morning and evening)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hxfjznn3djlb1.jpg?width=1857&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e2ceff120a89fee7468eae53c8c946b65573cf61",
